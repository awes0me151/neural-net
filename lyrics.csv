Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
"Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby"
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
"Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation"
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
"I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby"
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
"Baby, baby"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Baby, baby"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Baby, baby"
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
"Oh I, I miss my baby"
I miss my baby
"I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby"
"Ooh I, I miss my baby I don't want you to be no slave"
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
"Love to you, ooh baby"
"Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes"
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing you can't do
But keep me making love to me
"Love to me, ooh baby"
"Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk"
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do is make your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just want to make love to you
"Love to you, ooh yeah"
"Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk"
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do baby is make your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just want to make love to you
"Love to you, ooh yeah"
"Love to you, yeah"
Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
"Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?"
"Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
"That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies"
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
"Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
"That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares"
"Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made"
"Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart"
"Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark"
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
"And you played it, to the beat"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told"
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
"And you played it, to the beat"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
"But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)"
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
"It all, it all, it all"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all"
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all"
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
"You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me"
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
"But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?"
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
"But it don't matter, it clearly"
"Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?"
"It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry"
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
"But it don't matter, it clearly"
"Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore"
"Oh, anymore"
"Oh, anymore"
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
"But it don't matter, it clearly"
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
"Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong"
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
"And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me"
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
"Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong"
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
"'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,"
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
"Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew"
"All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true"
"And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you"
"I could stay there, close my eyes"
"Feel you here, forever"
"You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew"
"All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true"
"And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain"
And I threw us into the flames
"Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that"
"That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door"
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain"
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
"'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh"
"Oh, oh Let it burn, oh"
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
"My God, this reminds me"
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
"That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie"
You still sound like a song
"My God, this reminds me"
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
"My God, this reminds me"
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
"Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old"
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
"no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue"
I'd go crawling down the avenue
"No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do"
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
"You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true"
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
"Even if, it leads nowhere"
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
"Should I give up,"
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
"You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said"
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
"But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
"The reason you loved me before,"
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
"The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness"
"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
"But don't you remember, don't you remember?"
The reason you loved me before
"Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe"
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
"To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?"
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
"When will I see you again? She, she ain't real"
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
"Sure, she's got it all"
"But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds"
You made a fool out of you
"And, boy, she's bringing you down"
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
"Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age"
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
"Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds"
You made a fool out of me
"And, boy, you're bringing me down"
"You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core"
"But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh"
"Rumor has it, ooh All of these words whispered in my ear"
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
"Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it"
People say crazy things
"Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it"
"Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh,"
"Rumor has it, ooh But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for You've been on my mind"
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
"Every feeling, every word"
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
"To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only"
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
"Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared"
'Cause I've been here before
"Every feeling, every word"
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
"To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only"
"I promise I'm worthy, mm"
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
"Trust me I've learned it So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only"
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
"To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile"
Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance
"To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile"
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
"But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
"The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
"But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
"Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you dear?
"Is there anyone I could call?"""
"No and thank you, please Madam."
"I ain't lost, just wandering"" Round my hometown"
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
"I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades"
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
"Of my world, yeah"
Of my world
"Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war"
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
"All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables"
"Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me"
"No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me"
I can't give you what you think you gave me
"It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see"
"Where love is lost, your ghost is found"
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
"As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables"
"Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no"
"I won't ask you, you to just desert me"
I can't give you what you think you gave me
"It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior"
When the thunder calls to me
"Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior"
"Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no"
"I won't ask you, you to just desert me"
I can't give you what you think you gave me
"It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables"
"Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end"
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
"Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall"
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
"You may have my number, you can take my name"
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
"At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me"
"You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm"
You told me you were ready
"For the big one, for the big jump"
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all

"If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)"
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
"Learning to fly, learning to run"
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
"Look up to the sky, not just the floor"
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
"I miss the air, I miss my friends"
"I miss my mother, I miss it when"
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
"Look up to the sky, not just the floor"
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
"I miss the air, I miss my friends"
"I miss my mother, I miss it when"
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
"Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby"
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
"Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation"
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
"I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby"
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
"So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh"
"Baby, baby"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Baby, baby"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Baby, baby"
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
"Oh I, I miss my baby"
I miss my baby
"I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby"
"Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave"
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
"This is never ending, we have been here before"
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
"I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby"
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
"Lights go down, lights go down"
"Lights go down, lights go down"
"Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out"
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Pull me in, hold me tight"
"Don't let go, baby give me light"
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Pull me in, hold me tight"
"Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves"
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
"Lights go down, lights go down"
"Lights go down, lights go down"
"Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out"
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Pull me in, hold me tight"
"Don't let go, baby give me light"
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Pull me in, hold me tight"
"Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark"
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
"Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out"
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Pull me in, hold me tight"
"Don't let go, baby give me light"
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Pull me in, hold me tight"
"Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you"
"I miss you, I miss you"
"I miss you, I miss you"
"I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be"
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
"Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life"
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
"That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you"
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
"Your love, it is my truth"
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
"That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep"
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
"I will be, I will be"
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
"That I will be, I will be, I will be"
"Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?"
Tried my best
"Gave you everything I had, everything and no less"
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
"But go on and take it, take it all with you"
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
"Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see"
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
"So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily"
"I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you"
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
"Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must"
"Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust"
"Oh if only, if only you knew"
"Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you"
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
"Just take it, take it all with you"
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
"Just take it all, with my love"
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
"And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you"
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
"So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted"
I'm going back to where I started
"The morning rain, the morning rain"
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
"It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you"
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
"Love to you, ooh baby"
"Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes"
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing you can't do
But keep me making love to me
"Love to me, ooh baby"
"Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk"
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do is make your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just want to make love to you
"Love to you, ooh yeah"
"Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk"
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do baby is make your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just want to make love to you
"Love to you, ooh yeah"
"Love to you, yeah"
Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
"No, you won't"
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
"When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes"
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
"No, you won't"
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
"When you don't, ooh don't"
"You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time"
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
"Please forgive me, for my sins"
"Yes, I swam dirty waters"
But you pushed me in
"I've seen your face, under every sky"
Over every border and on every line
"You know my heart, more than I do"
"We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us"
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
"I'll be better to you,"
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
"I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us"
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
"Feel the Earth move, and then"
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
"So overdue, I owe them"
"Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
And face it all together
"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
"But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
And face it all together
"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
And face it all together
"At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
"And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
And face it all together
"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles"
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
"I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)"
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
"Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)"
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
"I can't help feeling, we could've had it all"
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
"It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all..."
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
"But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,"
"They don't know you like I do,"
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
"I can't bear this time,"
"It drags, as I lose my mind"
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
"Wake me up, wake me up when all is done"
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
I'm willing to take the risk
"I won't go, I can't do it on my own,"
"If this is ain't love, then what is?"
"I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,"
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
"Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
I'm willing to take the risk
"I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
"I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up"
"Bursting at the seams, no doubt"
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
"But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
I'm willing to take the risk
"I won't go, I can't do it on my own"
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
"I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?"
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
"He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait"
"I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go"
He can't do it on his own
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
He's willing to take the risk
"So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,"
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
"I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,"
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
"That I never knew, never knew"
All the things you'd say
"They were never true, never true"
And the games you play
"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
Watched it pour as I touched your face
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
"That I never knew, never knew"
All the things you'd say
"They were never true, never true"
And the games you play
"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
Watched it pour as I touched your face
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,"
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
"Well, it felt something died"
'Cause I knew that that was
"The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,"
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
"Your name I set fire to the rain,"
And I threw us into the flames
"Well, it felt something died"
"'Cause I knew that, that was the last time"
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
"With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep"
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
"And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing"
That I can't adore
"The way I'm running, with you, honey"
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
"That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now"
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
"All of my life, I've been frozen"
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
"Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now"
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
"All of my life, I've been frozen"
"The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby"
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
"All my life, you're my darkness"
You're the right kind of madness
"And you're my hope, you're my despair"
"You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion"
Hitting me like an explosion
"All of my life, I've been frozen"
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
"When did it go wrong, I will never know"
I have loved you all my life
"How did it slow down, I go round and round"
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
"This love, it ain't over yet"
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
"It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat"
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
"Why were you so cold, let the truth be told"
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
"What was I thinking, I gave you everything"
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
"It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat"
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
"It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat"
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
"Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon"
"Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true."
"I fall short each time,"
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
"Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all."
"Like a bomb before explosion,"
"Ticking by your call,"
"You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,"
"And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,"
"Than I ever did you before,"
"So stand beside the river I cried,"
And lay yourself down.
"Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees"
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
"To whisper ""will you leave your man? """
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
"I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,"
"Than I ever did you before,"
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
"Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,"
You must be mistaken
"I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong"
"And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,"
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
"Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,"
"You said I'm crazy,"
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
"Turns me crazy,"
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
"And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,"
"If you want me to stop I'll freeze,"
"And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,"
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
"I wish you'd come over,"
"Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,"
Strips me down bare
"And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,"
"But the more I do,"
"The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,"
Hoping you'll walk through
"And save me boy,"
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
"But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made"
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
"But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough"
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
"There was something in the water, now that something's in me"
"Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
"I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late"
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
"Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance"
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
"No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
"I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins"
"It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
"Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham"
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in"
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will"
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love"
"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes"
"If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down"
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
When I don't get nothing back
"Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind"
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
When I don't get nothing back
"Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms"
"I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying"
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
When I don't get nothing back
"Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain"
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
"Please wear the face, the one where you smile"
"Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired"
I need to get away to feel again
"Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind"
"Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself"
"Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind"
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
"Excuse me first love, but we're through"
"I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired"
"I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire"
"Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love"
"Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end"
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
"Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall"
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
"You may have my number, you can take my name"
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
"And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you"
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
"So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted"
I'm going back to where I started
"The morning rain, the morning rain"
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
"It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you"
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
"You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up"
I say your name like there should be an us
"I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love"
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
"When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied"
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
"Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool"
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
"Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
"Whatever it is, I depend on it"
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
"I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me"
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
"You ignited a spark, let the fires away"
"Are you ready, ready?"
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
"Every piece and part, you were the first"
"I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,"
It's out of my hands
"Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why"
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
"I want you It's above and beyond me,"
It's out of my hands
"Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why"
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
"I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in"
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
"You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that"
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
"You like to be so close, I like to be alone"
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
"Walking with each other,"
"Think we'll never match at all, but we do"
"But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more"
"I've never known this, never before"
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
"You're so provocative, I'm so conservative"
"You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining"
"You think we would and we do,"
"But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,"
"In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,"
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
"You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that"
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
"You like to be so close, I like to be alone"
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
"Walking with each other,"
"Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face"
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
"Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?"
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
"Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes"
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
"Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life"
All I ever will recall of my life
"Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?"
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
"Yours too baby, come on now"
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
"How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know"
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
"And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,"
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
"Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong"
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
"That I never knew, never knew"
All the things you'd say
"They were never true, never true"
And the games you play
"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
Watched it pour as I touched your face
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
"That I never knew, never knew"
All the things you'd say
"They were never true, never true"
And the games you play
"You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain"
Watched it pour as I touched your face
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,"
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
"Well, it felt something died"
'Cause I knew that that was
"The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,"
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,"
"Your name I set fire to the rain,"
And I threw us into the flames
"Well, it felt something died"
"'Cause I knew that, that was the last time"
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
"You can read my mind, be it truth or lies"
"Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart"
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
"Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)"
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
"Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)"
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
"Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why"
"Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,"
you came along and changed my mind
"I should leave the past behind me,"
"I should let you find me,"
supposed to stay beside me
"You were supposed to guide me,"
"through the ups and downs,"
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
"`cause you and me, we`re good"
"And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk"
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
"Even when I've had too much,"
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
"but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,"
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
"I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,"
I don`t really wanna see you
"and I don`t want you to see me,"
"you would think that I was crazy,"
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
"Even when I've had too much,"
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
"`cause you and me, we`re good"
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
"Even when I've had too much,"
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
"Even when I've had too much,"
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
"Oh, honey"
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
"Oh, they smeared it"
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
"I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot"
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
"Oh, that you know"
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
"Oh, that you know"
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
"I find the less I look, more I find"
"So let's go back there, back to the star"
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
"Let's go back there, back to the star"
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
"When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star"
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
"Let's go back there, back to the star"
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
"Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces"
And we'll watch them turn to dust
"But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star"
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
"Let's go back there, back to the star"
You know I'm never gonna leave you
"'cause you're the only one I want, yeah"
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
"No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor"
"Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door"
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
"There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out"
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
"Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall"
"Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue"
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
"Oh, baby"
I feel so down
"Oh, and turned me off"
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
"Oh, baby"
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
"Out that door Well, I've been in town"
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
"Oh, baby, I feel so down"
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
"No, girlfriends"
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
"Oh, baby"
Don't feel so down
"Oh, and turned me off"
When I feel left out
"So I, I turned around"
"Oh, baby"
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
"Yeah Oh, people"
They don't understand
"No, girlfriends"
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
"Oh, baby"
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
"Oh, little girl"
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
"Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind"
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
"Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory"
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
"I thought of me, I want to see"
I want to feel my heartbeat so
"With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart"
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
"My heart so bad, it cuts through"
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
"Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait"
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
"I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait"
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
"So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here"
"You know when to make me, imagine you're here"
"You know when to make me, imagine you're here"
"You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl"
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town Steady as she goes

Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes

You've found yourself

You're not already...
Feel the pain running through my veins
"Don't you piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious"
Other words are spring to me
"... emolicious, for the shoot posses no... And you want me to respect you"
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
"Help, help oh oh. Chorus:"
This time you're on your own
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
"Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco, fiasco"
"... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco"
1 2 3 4.
Hustle...
Wanna try to testify in a... of happiness
"Be the best, have success,"
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood Feel blessed not impressed
By the glamour if you think you could. And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
"Help, help oh oh. Chorus:"
This time you're on your own
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
"Fiasco, call it fiasco, fiasco"
"... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco"
"1 2 3 4. Fiasco, fiasco [Chorus:]"
1 2 3 4
"I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,"
"I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,"
"I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco. "
Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
"Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean"
"If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say"
"Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams"
"Baby, I'm from New York"
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
"Hear it from New York, New York, New York! On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard"
"Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God"
"Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge"
"Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams"
"Baby, I'm from New York"
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
"Hear it from New York, New York, New York! One hand in the air for the big city,"
"Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty"
No place in the world that can compare
"Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah In New York"
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
"Hear it from New York! She's just a girl, and she's on fire"
"Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway"
"She's living in a world, and it's on fire"
"Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away"
"Oh, she got both feet on the ground"
And she's burning it down
"Oh, she got her head in the clouds"
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
"This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame"
"So bright, she can burn your eyes"
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
"Oh, we got our feet on the ground"
And we're burning it down
"Oh, got our head in the clouds"
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
"This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by"
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
"But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire"
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
"Oh, oh, oh,"
"She's just a girl, and she's on fire I just want you close"
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
"But all I know is everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one"
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
"No one, no one, no one"
"Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you"
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
"But all I know is everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one"
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
"No one, no one, no one"
"Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you"
Can get in the way of what I feel for you I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try try to divide something so real
"So til the end of time I'm telling you there is no one No one, no one, no one"
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
"No one, no one, no one"
"Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you Oh oh oh oh"
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
"Some people live for the power, yeah"
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
"And I've been there before, and that life's a bore"
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
"If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain"
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
"With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all"
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all

That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
"Baby, I'm from [Chorus]"
"New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of"
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
"Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew"
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
"Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city"
"Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty"
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
"Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Moment of honesty"
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now You give me a feeling that I never felt before
"And I deserve it, I think I deserve it"
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
"And I deserve it, I know I deserve it"
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
"The way that I love you Oh, oh, I never felt this way"
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
"The way that I love you Oh, baby"
"I, I, I, I'm fallin'"
"I, I, I, I'm fallin'"
Fall I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you What? Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
"Near me, touch me, feel me And even at the bottom of the sea"
I could still hear inside my head
"Telling me, touch me, feel me"
"And all the time, you were telling me lies So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
"Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
"Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?"
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
"Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound"
"Why don't you hold me, need me"
"I thought you told me, you'd never leave me Looking in the sky I could see your face"
Then I knew right where I fit in
"Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you"
"Right till the end So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
"Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
"Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart"
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
"And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight"
"I'll make it without you tonight So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
"Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you"
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
"Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Some people live for the fortune"
Some people live just for the fame
"Some people live for the power, yeah"
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
"And I've been there before, and that life's a bore"
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
"If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain"
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
"With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all"
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
"If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me baby"
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby Everywhere I'm turning
Nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching
For the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
"And all my women, all my women sitting here trying"
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters
Coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
And I start to get weak
Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
"We can fly, ooh I am a Superwoman"
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
"I'm a Superwoman Oh ooh Baby, baby, baby"
From the day I saw you
"Really, really wanted to catch your eye"
Somethin' special 'bout you
I must really like you
"'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time, ooh Oh baby, baby, baby"
It's getting kind of crazy
'Cause you are taking over my mind And it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
"I swear, it feels like ooh"
You don't know my name
"(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know) Oh, baby, baby, baby"
I see us on our first date
Doing everything that makes me smile
When we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
"Ooh it set my soul on fire Ooh baby, baby, baby"
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
"And I swear it baby, it feels like ooh"
You don't know my name
"(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know) I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me"
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
"I'm feelin' like, oh"
Doing nothing I've ever done
For anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you 'Cause did I mention (oh)
You bout' to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels
"To have, all my affection"
"And you'll never get a chance to experience, my lovin' (oh)"
'Cause my lovin' feels like Ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it feels like
Ooh
You don't my name You don't know my name
"Baby, baby I swear"
It's like
Ooh You don't know my name
It feels like
Ooh
And you don't my name
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Ooh
Ooh
Will you ever know? You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
"Make love tenderly to last, to last"
'Cause baby you know I'm worth it Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
"She will if she can find a man who knows her worth 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her"
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth If you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
'Cause baby I know you're worth it She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
"She will if she can find a man who knows her worth 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her"
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (spelled out for you)
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value (better value)
A woman's (woman's)
Woman's (woman's)
"Worth! 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her"
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (first baby)
"And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her"
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (first baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth Here's my ghetto story (story)
Been in hell through the fire
"Now we, gonna take it higher"
Here's my survival story (story)
So many reasons to sing this
Now we got the keys to the kingdom I remember those days when hell was my home
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone

I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome
I remember when we run Fatta get him knee blown
"An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome"

"An Mikey madda fly him out, cause she get a loan"

"Rah, rah, rah, rah We got the kingdom so we got to make way"
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
"Rah, rah, rah, rah I remember those days when we was dead broke an"
I could barely find a dolla for a token
Hop in the train to just get where I'm going
"Hobos after me, runnin' like I'm smokin'"
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny I remember playin' over needles in the streets
Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue
Sellin' bodies for doh
Remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
Gonna make it someday gonna be somebody
Say mommy don??????t worry cause its just u and me
"One day we will get out of this misery (hey!) We get di ting dem, dem outta luck now"
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk no
"Rah, rah, rah, rah We got the kingdom so we got to make way"

And now the whole community can live greatly

Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
"Me say Mikey It's been a while, I'm not who I was before"
"You look surprised, your words don't burn me anymore"
"Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it's clear to see"
"Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me"
"Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free Careful with your ego, he's the one that we should blame"
Had to grab my heart back
God know something had to change
I thought that you'd be happy
"I found the one thing I need, why you mad"
It's just the brand new kind of me It took a long long time to get here
"It took a brave, brave girl to try"
"It took one too many excuses, one too many lies"
"Don't be surprised, don't be surprised if i talk a little louder"
If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I'd be known to you too long
If you noticed that I'm different
Don't take it personally
"Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me"
"And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free Oh, it took a long long road to get here"
It took a brave brave girl to try
"I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies"
"Don't be surprised, oh see you look surprised Hey, if you were a friend, you want to get know me again"
If you were worth a while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry
I'm too busy finding myself
I got this
"I found me, I found me, yeah I don't need your opinion"
I'm not waiting for your okay
"I'll never be perfect, but at least now I'm brave"
"Now, my heart is open"
And I can finally breathe
"Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of free"
"That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me"
"Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me We're at the crossroads, my dear"
Where do we go from here?
"Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay"
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
"All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears"
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
"No, said don't you leave me this way"
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
"All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears"
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
"(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?"
"All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears If I had no more time"
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had'
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again Oh oh oh How many really know what love is'
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me baby)
Every time you touch me
(See we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(See everyday we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again) Oh oh oh oh oh This song is dedicated
To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? Know I never let you down
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
"And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are"
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
"Distance and time, I'll be waiting Distance and time, I'll be waiting"
"Will you take a train, to meet me where I am"
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
"And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are"
No matter how long it takes him
"Distance and time, I'll be waiting"
And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time
I'll be waiting No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
"Through distance and time, I'll be waiting"
And you can walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
"Through distance and time, I'll be waiting Oh oh oh, oh"
"Oh oh oh, hey"
Oh oh oh oh I'll be waiting
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? JW: Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
AK: One with the golden gun poison in your fantasy
JW: Another bill from a killer turned a thrill into a tragedy CHORUS:
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think that you can trust is just
Another way to die JW: Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one that will never see the sunshine
AK: Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother in the nick of time
"JW: Another dirty money, heaven sent honey turning on a dime [CHORUS] Its just another way to Hey Its just another way to Youve got to. JW: Another girl with her finger on the world singing do what you wanna hear"
AK: Another gun thrown down and surrendered took away your fear
"JW & AK: Another man that stands right behind you looking in the mirror [CHORUS] Its just another way Suit em up, bang bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang. Said I'd be gone by five"
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head
"Look at you, look at you"
Look what you made me do
"How do you, how do you think know my every move"
Who are you Who are you You look so familiar
"I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth We got way too much in common"
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
"Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply"
We both know we had no patience together day and night
"Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied"
I could love you all occasions We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
"You must be messed up too Messed up too, messed up too"
"Just like you, just like you"
"Messed up too, messed up too"
"Just like you, just like you We got way too much in common"
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too Everybody say oh oh oh oh
Driving in a fast car

"Oh oh oh oh She's just a girl, and she's on fire"
"Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway"
"She's living in a world, and it's on fire"
"Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away"
"Oh, she got both feet on the ground"
And she's burning it down
"Oh, she got her head in the clouds"
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
"This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame"
"So bright, she can burn your eyes"
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
"Oh, we got our feet on the ground"
And we're burning it down
"Oh, got our head in the clouds"
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
"This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by"
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
"But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire"
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
"Oh, oh, oh,"
"She's just a girl, and she's on fire Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care"
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over
That just wont be fair
Darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street
No food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over
When you said goodbye! All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
"From afar, seems I had it all"
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Now I see myself through different eyes
It's no surprise!
Being alone will make you realize
When it's over!
All in love is fair I shoulda been there
"I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda All at once"
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
"From afar, seems I had it all"
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I know I pushed you away
What can I do that would save our love
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone I shoulda been there
"I shoulda been there, I shoulda, I shoulda All at once"
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar
Seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone Get so caught up everyday
Tryna keep it all together
While the time it slips away
You see I know nothing last forever Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
"So all I can say I wanna tell you something, give you something"
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
"Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day"
"I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late (I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait)"
"(I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait) Just a simple conversation"
Just a moment is all it takes
I wanna be there just to listen
(I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There would be no limit to my sorrow
'Cause there's nothing that could fill that space
I don't wanna put it off for too long
I didn't say all that I had to say
"I wanna take my time and right the wrong before we get to that place I wanna tell you something, give you something"
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
"Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day"
"I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late Just lean on my shoulder,"
It's not over till it's over
Don't worry about it cause
I'm gonna make sure our bond gets stronger
"I don't wanna wait till the storm and something wrong and now you're gone and I can't find you I wanna tell you something, give you something"
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
"Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day"
"I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late I wanna tell you something, give you something"
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
"Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day"
"I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait"
"I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait"
"I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait"
"I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,"
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
"Baby, I'm from [Chorus]"
"New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of"
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
"Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew"
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
"Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city"
"Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty"
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
"Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Said I'd be gone by five"
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head
"Look at you, look at you"
Look what you made me do
"How do you, how do you think know my every move"
Who are you Who are you You look so familiar
"I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth We got way too much in common"
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
"Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply"
We both know we had no patience together day and night
"Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied"
I could love you all occasions We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
"You must be messed up too Messed up too, messed up too"
"Just like you, just like you"
"Messed up too, messed up too"
"Just like you, just like you We got way too much in common"
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary I feel such a connection
"Even when you're far away, mm"
"Oh baby, if there is anything that you fear (anything)"
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
"(Yeah, mhum, a yeah, you know what?) Only we know what is talked about baby boy"

"I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me boy I won't tell your secrets"
Your secrets are safe with me

"Your secrets, your secrets, break it down"
Secret secret I know the player
With the slick
Trigger finger
For her majesty
Another one
With the
Golden tone voice
And then your fantasy
Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thrill
"Into a tragedy Yeah, a door left open"
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey
"Turning on a dime Well, a door left open"
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die Hey
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Another girl
With her finger
On the world singing
Do what you want here
Another gun thrown down
And surrendered
Took away your fear
Hey
Another man
That stands right
Behind you
Looking in the mirror A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die
It's just another way
It's just another way
Baby Baby Weren't you the one that said
That you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space
And give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried
And tried to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone
And that I had to leave (Now you) talkin' bout a family
(Now you) sayin' I complete your dream
(Now you) sayin' I'm your everything
"You're confusing me, what you say to me"
"Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause (What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me"
"(What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone"
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn' And when you came home
You'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want
Just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through (Now you) wanna be up under me
"(Now you) have so much to say to me, hey"
(Now you) want to make time for me
"What you do to me, your confusing me"
"Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause (What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Now who's cryin, desirin' to come back to me"
"(What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Now who's cryin, desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone"
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'
"Night after night, knowing somethin' goin' on"
Wasn't long before I be g-g-gone
"Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me"
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you supposed to do
"No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you (What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me"
"(What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Gotta stop cryin', to come back to me (Goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"He's cryin', cryin, my baby"
And it goes around
"(What goes around, comes around"
"What goes up, must come down)"
"Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me Can't wait till I get home"

That I would want someone to hold me
"Show me like you, falling in a daze"
"So many ways, I'm in amazement Thinking about you, no one took the time"
"To hold my mind, and be the kind"
"That I could talk to, this is the type of day"
"That I must say, I've been looking forward to Look at me shedding no tears"
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love Talking on the phone
"When I'm alone, I'm in the zone"
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades The way you take time for me
"It makes me want you, call it what you want"
It may be wrong but baby I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love
I'm waiting for your love
Waiting for your love Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away baby
'Cause there is nothing those bars can do I will be the rising moon after setting sun
Just to let you know that you'll always have someone
I will be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is I use to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world it can be so fake
And all that matters I'm telling you
Is you and me only
And the fortunes of love we make I will be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you will always have my hand
I will be the woman you need to be a better man
So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
"That's how strong my love is Oh, can nothing break us down"
"Oh, cause we are heaven bound"
Like the mountain standing tall
And moving over here to stay
"Oh, can nothing get in the way Through a shake of an earthquake"
I will never fall (I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is
(that's how strong my love my love is)
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all (we can risk it all)
That's how strong my love is (love is) Through the deepest water

Like the moon in the sky
That it would never come down
That's how strong my love is

And it was raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy about it
You'll say I told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came 'round
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Sometimes
Some lies
Can take a minute
To fully realize
His tears
Your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door
Can't take it anymore I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned I keep your picture upside my bed (umm)
And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
"Pappa, now you're gone"
"What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good"
"How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night"
I still like it better when you holding me tight
"Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no"
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
"All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good"
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
"If you don't call me, pappa"
"Oh, you got to try"
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh)
"Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me"
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
"Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in"
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
"Woah, hallelujah, let me in Every step makes me think that I'm closer"
But somehow I just never arrived
"When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears"
"I need you right by my side Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in"
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
"Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, hallelujah"
"Woah, woah, hallelujah"
All the places I've been
Please forgive me for my sins
"Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, let me in"
"Woah, woah, let me in"
"Woah, woah"
Please forgive me for my sins
"Woah, hallelujah, let me in Ooh, yeah"
"Uh, you know, hey"
You know you may think
"That you know you got me under wraps, locks and keys and"
"And that without you I just, I'm gonna be lost"
"But I got somethin' else for you Baby, I used to sit home waitin' for your call"
I used to have your picture hangin' on my wall
"Used to think you were right, but you was wrong"
"I used to miss you, now I'm glad that you're gone, I,"
"uh Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more"

Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Pray to Him
He will show When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you safe
Stand strong and you will grow Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while you are on the ground
"Don't let any emotions show, hmm People always speculate"
Don't let them get in your way
See they say things they don't know Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need them
Cause your stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever
Sing Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile Ooh
Wait til you see my smile
Ooh
Wait til they see your smile If war is holy and sex is obscene
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
"Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin"
"Divided by difference, sexuality and skin Oh, so we can hate each other and fear each other"
We can build these walls between each other
"Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick"
"Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in"
"Yeah, we can hate each other and fear each other"
We can build these walls between each other
"Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick"
"Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked Oh, maybe we should love somebody"
"Oh, maybe we could care a little more"
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
"And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream"
"Living for love, unafraid of the end"
"Forgiveness is the only real revenge Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other"
We can break these walls between each other
"Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick"
"Keep yourself open, yourself open"
"Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other"
We can break these walls between each other
"Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick"
"Keep yourself open, you're open So maybe we should love somebody"
Maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love is holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
'Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar There will never come a day
You will ever hear me say
"That I want, or need to be without you"
I wanna give my all Baby just hold me
Sweetly control me
Because your arms
they keep away the lonely When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I never felt this way about loving
No
Never felt so alive
Baby
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
"This is for the warrior, this is for you and I"
"This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind"
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
"Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute"
"Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it"
"Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet"
"Run through the flames, that's more passion for me"
"I passed that, this morning just so the world can see"
"Got them wolves on me, no watch me like em clean"
"I know, i know, my pride, my ghost, my eyes"
"My lows, i know i know, its mind control"
"I know i could prosper, no impostor"
Prosecute my posture
"I stand up and I stand by it what I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote"
"And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope"
"I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes"
"And even when I'm tired, gold is the only word i know And the night is takin' over"
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
"By the second, losin' focus"
"Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off"
Unless you
"I bet you wonder how I go on Ill simply say its on again, its on again"
"The world don't stop, it's on again I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles"
"Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow"
"In the midst of all this darkness, i sacrifice my ego"
"There is no room for selfish, we do it for the people And the night is takin' over"
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
"By the second, losin' focus"
"Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off"
Unless you
"I bet you wonder how I go on The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop"
And everybody here trying to get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
"Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go"
Nah
So you think you're hot?
"Gotta grind hard, give it all you got"
"You can have, or you can have not"
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto) And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
"By the second, losin' focus"
"Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off"
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
"Some people live for the power, yeah"
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
"And I've been there before, and that life's a bore"
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
"If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain"
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
"With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all"
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
"If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me baby"
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I dont worry cuz
Everythings going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
"But all i know is everythings going to be alright No one, no one, no one"
Can get in the way of what Im feeling
"No one, no one, no one"
"Can get in the way of what I feel for you, ...you, ...you"
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I dont worry cuz
Everythings going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
"But all i know is everythings going to be alright No one, no one, no one"
Can get in the way of what Im feeling
"No one, no one, no one"
"Can get in the way of what I feel for you, ...you, ...you"
Can get in the way of what I feel I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
"I know people will try, try to divide something so real"
"So til the end of time Im telling you there is no one No one, no one"
Can get in the way of what Im feeling
"No one, no one, no one"
"Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you"
Can get in the way of what I feel for you Yeah
It's crazy
It's crazy
"Come on, come on yeah"
I wanna tell you really
"Oh yeah, all I wanna know yeah"
Hey
I wanna know yeah Hey baby how you doing tonight
I wanna let you know
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I wanna love you baby
And it's going so right
I wanna burn a candle
Turn the darkness to the light With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay away
No no no
"Stay away Hi baby, won't you tell me the truth"
You wanna be the one
You can't stay away
"Oh, hey darling"
Don't you make no excuse
We can chase this on
And burn the hole inside you From the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
With the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
"I can't stay, I can't stay away This invisible bullet and it takes us to the stars"
It's getting higher and higher
"It's the fire we make, (it's the fire we make)"
Getting sweeter and sweeter
Like a night to a day
(about to make up this flame)
"I can't stay away, say is, no no (yeah)"
"No no no, no no no, can't stay away (can't stay)"
No no no (oh you can't)
No no no (baby baby baby)
"No no no, yeah I wanna tell you, I wanna love you"
I just wanna stay with you

I just can't stay away
I wanna make some much fire with you baby
"I wanna go, gonna go to you darling, ah"
"I say yeah yeah Nasty, yeah, yeah (New York, New York)"
"Hey yo black it's time again, yeah, yeah (New York, New York)"
"Come here, yeah, yeah (New York, New York)"
Hey yo black it's time If you knew my streets
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
"Who snitchin', who told police"
"Who came home, who still gone, who restin' in peace Now they killin' over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it"
Because thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
"Musician and flatten composition A pain, I'm like Saddam Hussein"
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
"I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson"
"Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons The P's breathe Warriorz and skullies and Timmies"
"Around mixed, spics, niggaz and giddies"
From my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
"It's a New York State of Mind New York, New York, New York"
"New York City, whoa oh"
"New York, New York, New York"
"New York City, baby It's like a jungle, out here"
"So much struggle, out here"
And my dream's still unphased
Greed still the cousin of death Always feels like always somethin' farther time
In the Streets of New York All I see is street homes
"And who it's holdin', our people"
Only comforts the brain
"It's like I'm going insane The revolution has to start, don't waste no time"
In the Streets of New York (New York state of mind)
"C'mon New York, New York, New York, New York oh"
State of mind (New York City)
"New York, New York, New York, New York oh"
State of crime (New York City)
"New York, New York, New York, New York oh"
Big dreams (New York City)
"New York, New York, New York, New York oh"
"Big schemes Oh, it's like the game"
Just ain't the same
Baby loves and girls with no shame
"Can't get away (get away), epidemic plague"
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons 'cause relief is hard to find In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
"A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin'"
Mind stressin' tryin' to find a record crime shreddin'
"Time precious, I ain't have rest since nine eleven I live fast, hustle like today is my last"
"I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave."
"Crack bein' raw, gats squeezin' off"
"Manhattan squeezin' off, from cats who tease with war The eve of the Apocalypse, evil keep movin' politics"
"Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis"
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
"Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera So New York City walk with me, talk gritty"
It's up to us New York it's our city
"Here the man come with the anthem, hands up"
"It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up New York, New York, New York"
"New York City, whoa oh"
"New York, New York, New York"
"New York City, baby"
"New York, New York, New York"
"New York City, whoa oh"
"New York, New York, New York"
"New York City, baby Clap Your Hands Everybody"

And I still remember everything you said (umm)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (oh)
Always thought you'll be by my side
"Pappa, now you're gone"
"What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good"
"How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night"
I still like it better when you holding me tight
"Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no"
Telling me baby baby baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart
"All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good"
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
"If you don't call me, pappa"
"Oh, you got to try"
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
Please (oh oh)
"Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me"
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
How come you don't call me
How come you don't call me Na na na na no
No no no
Na na na na no
"No no no The sand loves when, the waves come"
"The sky can't wait, for the light of the sun"
"So how could you, look me in my eye"
And not see what what I feel inside
"Tell me how could you, doubt the fact that I"
"I love you,"
"I love you Don't you ever, think like that."
"Don't you ever, never do that?"
"There will never be two things, that go together better"
"Than you and me North needs south east needs west,"
"And no needs, yes yes yes"
"Up needs down life needs death,"
"And no needs, yes yes yes I need you"

Look me in my eye
And not see what what I feel inside
Tell me how could you
Doubt the fact that I
"I love you,"

Think like that
"Don't you ever,"
Never do that?
There will never be two things
That go together better
"Than you and me North needs south east needs west,"
"And no needs,"
Yes yes yes
"Up needs down life needs death,"
"And no needs,"
Yes yes yes I need you

Some people live just for the fame
"Some people live for the power, yeah"
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
"And I've been there before, and that life's a bore"
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all

Some people want diamond rings

But everything means nothing
"If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain"
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
"With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all"
But I don't want nothing at all

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything

Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I?m telling you that No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
"And it's a long, long way to heaven"
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel? 'Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
"And it's a long, long way to heaven"
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
"Please, send me an angel"
"Can you send me an angel? To guide me, to guide me home"
"[Incomprehensible] so bad, so bad right now"
"Oh, won't you be somebody's angel right now And the day came"
When the risk it took to remain tightly closed in a bud
Was more painfully than the risk it took to bloom
"This is the element of freedom I'll make the darkness light before you,"
"What is wrong I'll make it right before you,"
"All the battles I will fight down for you,"
"And the high place I'll bring down. And the high place I'll bring down. Mm, bye bye How do you love someone"
"That hurts you, oh, so bad"
With intentions good?
"Was all he ever had Well, how do I let go when I've loved him for so long"
And I've given him all that I could? Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
"To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye"
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
"To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye"
(Find the words to say goodbye) I know now I was naive
"Never knew where this would lead, yeah"
"And I'm not tryin' to take away, oh no"
"From the good man that he is Well, how do I let go when I've"
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could? Was it something wrong that we did?
Or 'cause others infiltrated?
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
"To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye"
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) Is this the end? Are you sure?
How should you know
When you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
"And this is the one and only love I've ever known, so (How do you find the words to say, to say goodbye"
When your heart don't have the heart to say
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye
Find the words to say goodbye) How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye When I wake up in the morning baby
Can't believe my eyes
"It is this a part of destiny, you're now in my life (now in my life)"
There is no better prize
Can't compare to you
"Ain't no words to describe the way that I'm feeling, yeah"
"When I look at you I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say"
"I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away"
"I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say"
"I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah True love finally found you baby"
Life becomes a way
"Prettiest things imagine up, oh yea"
Listen I don't wanna say
It only happens once to me when I call
Feel it deep in your soul
And like a fairy tale your story begins
"What a saint to the ... I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say"
"I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away"
"I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say"
"I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah Hey yeah, in the mornings when I rise up"
Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Staring at clouds like wow look at my love
Every day I'm feeling better cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
"We came for quit, remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude thinks he's all eh, think he's so fly"
And hates how you try to talk to me I'm like you're don't even there try
"I was on my solo groove, I ain't want nothing, I ain't need nothing"
"Man I'm good, now I'm speechless, cause I fell for it, the poet in me died cause I fell for it I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say"
"I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away"
"I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say"
"I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah I used to know all the words to say, I used to write all the poetry"
"But now you take my breath away, hahaha, hey. Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,"
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
"Baby, I'm from [Chorus]"
"New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of"
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
"Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew"
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
"Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city"
"Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty"
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
"Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Oh, oh, A-K!"
New day
"Oh, oh, A-K!"
"Ow! Party people say, party people say, ""Aye"
"It's a new day, it's a new day"""
"World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!"
"For a new day, for a new day,"
"Celebrate and say aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) It's alright to, to feel however you want to"
"There's no limitation, no"
"Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time"
"We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more"
"So we can do this all night, one time"
"Everybody say, ""Aye aye oh"" (oh) There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up"
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
"I know that it's coming, let the sun come up"
"Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, ""Aye"
"It's a new day, it's a new day"""
"World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!"
"For a new day, for a new day,"
"Celebrate and say aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) Take a look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready,"
"Aye, come alive let's get it"
"Aye, if you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time"
All night and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
One life left to live it up There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
"I know that it's coming, let the sun come up"
"Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, ""Aye"
"It's a new day, it's a new day"""
"World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!"
"For a new day, for a new day,"
"Celebrate and say, aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) I saw the world"
It's now or never at all

"Let the water rise and fall, oh"
"I'm gonna give it my all Party people say, party people say, ""Aye"
"It's a new day, it's a new day"""
"World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!"
"For a new day, for a new day,"
Celebrate and say Celebrate and say
Celebrate and say
(Celebrate) and say Check it out
It feels kinda crazy These covers
May keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
'Cause they never gonna hold me tight And these pillows
May let me rest my head
But they can't say good night
And tuck me in before I go to bed Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else These lips are missin' you
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win These candles
Light up my room at night
But they can't light the room they way you did
"When you walked inside, oh baby If these walls could sing"
About everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song
And it'll probably sound something like this Say now baby girl you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
But I'm lying to myself
Cause I know I don't want nobody else 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over (Gonna be over)
When everything in this room reminds me of you (You)
"Every time I think, I'm getting closer"
"'Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)"
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win And it feels so good
Don't you feel so good?
"Talk to me Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever"
Never seen this part of me
"I know that nothing last forever, however"
"Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow"
Cause tomorrow may not come
"And where my heart take me I follow, you gotta follow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest"
When they ask me how I spent my life
"At least I got to love you, when it's all over"
"When it's all said and done, when it's all over"
"At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Hey, ask when I wanna leave"
"A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me"
"Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow"
"All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest"
When they ask me how I spent my life
"At least I got to love you, when it's all over"
"When it's all said and done, when it's all over"
"At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Everybody say hey hey hey hey If I do nothing else, oh"
"If I do nothing else, oh"
"At least I got to love you, oh yeah"
"At least I got to love you, tell 'em baby If I do nothing else, oh"
"Don't gotta do nothing else, oh oh"
"At least I got to love you, hey"
At least I got to love you Everybody say hey hey hey hey
Everybody say hey hey hey hey I'm just tryna hold onto to a dream
Out here lost and nothing's what it seems
I'm just tryna find where I belong
This must be the dark before the dawn
When the place that you were born is not where you belong
"Tell me baby, what stops you from wearing a crown?"
"I wanna be somebody, be somebody"
"And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby"
"Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah"
"Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby"
"Back to life, life, I've been waiting for all of my life"
"Back to life, mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh Climb out from the bottom baby"
No more looking back only straight up
"Foot on the pedal baby, it's time to find what you're made of"
Everybody wants to be adored
You don't have to settle for being enough Back to life
Back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah"
Back to life I'm not made to be locked up
"If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?"
"Oh, I'm not meant to be locked up"
"And if I don't try, then what was I made for? Back to life"
Bck to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah"
Back to life Right now I feel like a bird
caged without a key
Ev'ryone comes to stare at me
with so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry They don't know what they're doing to me
keeping me from flying
That's why I say that I know why
the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
"so she can fly, fly, fly"
spreading her wings and her song?
"Let her fly, fly, fly"
the whole world to see She's like a caged bird
"Fly, fly, ooh, just let her fly"
"just let her fly, just let her fly"
spread her wings
"spread beauty, mm Here I am"
And I been thinking about you lately
Hold my hand
"Cause I been missing you like crazy Don't wanna go all night,"
Every single night

'Bout how you came with information
That's negative in every which way
Just dissin' my man and our relations
"You say he's cheatin,' want me to leave him"
"I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him"
Listenin' to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm tryin' to be 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no"
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Don't you turn and check my man out"
How 'bout you 'splain what that's all about
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
"But I got something for you, Doe"
"Mess around end up in a choke, hold"
"Girl, I think it's time for you to go"
Away from my man and me
That's the way it's gonna be 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no"
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no I love my man"
He loves me more
He may not be the perfect man
"But I don't plan to let him go for Jane Doe, oh oh 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go"
And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no"
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe

And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Crazy to let my man go"
And let some other Jane Doe
"Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Hey I might not really be your mother"
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya I think you're beautiful
I think you're perfect
I know how hard it gets
"But I swear it's worth it, worth it That's what you do, what you do, what you do"
What you do for love
"'Cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing"
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
"This blended family, but baby"
"That's what you do, what you do, what you do"
What you do for love I know it started with a little drama
I hate you had to read it in the paper
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
Baby everybody here you know adores ya I think it's beautiful
I think it's perfect
I know how hard it gets
"But I swear it's worth it, worth it That's what you do, what you do, what you do"
What you do for love
"'Cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing"
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
"This blended family, but baby"
"That's what you do, what you do, what you do"
"What you do for love, love For love, for love"
"I think it's, my real my true love"
"'Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily"
I believe love could bring us closer than blood I remember having four step-moms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Hit my sisters just for dinner 'cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mothers supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
"Flacko care, nobody else care"
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
"And god-sisters, who eventually slept with us"
"Real love, but you doin' it right, alright"
I'm here for you
"Everything's alright, alright That's what you do, what you do, what you do"
What you do for love (That's just what you do)
"There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing"
There ain't nothing I won't do for us (For you baby)
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
"That's what you do, what you do, what you do"
"What you do for love, love That's just what you do (for love)"
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever Ayo mo bee
Drop it on me
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"Let's do it like this, uh If I was your woman"
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more If I was your woman
If I was your woman
"And you were my man, yeah She tears you down darling"
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall 'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman Here's what I'd do
"I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you"
"Yeah, yeah Life is so crazy"
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman Here's what I'd do
"I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you If I were your woman"
Here's what I'd do
"I'd never, never, never stop loving you"
"Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I were your woman"
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
"I were your woman We're at the crossroads, my dear"
Where do we go from here?
"Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay"
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Where do we go from here?
"All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears"
Oh
When I cry your name
Am I crawling in bed
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Oh
Don't you do it
"No, said don't you leave me this way"
I don't know
If I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
"All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears"
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
"(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?"
"All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?"
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
"Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything Is it my turn to take you by your hands?"
"Tell you, I love you and you not hear me"
Is it my turn to totally understand?
"Watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,"
"If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby"
"If I have to take apart, all that I am"
"Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you"
"Inside I'd die without you, yeah babe Oh I apologize for all the things I've done"
Now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around?
"Oh, take every little piece of my heart (Piece of my heart)"
Take every little piece of my soul (Piece of my soul)
Take every little piece of my mind
"'Cause if you're gone, inside, I'd die without you Yeah 'cause inside I'd die without you"
Yeah baby I'd die without you
"Can't you see that I would die without you? If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,"
"If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby"
"If I have to take apart, all that I am"
"Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you Yeah I'd die without you"
"Oh don't you know that I would, die without you"
"Baby, see I would die without, I'd die without you"
"Oh die without you, die without you babe"
I don't know what I'd do without you babe Have you ever felt so strong
That may you feel weak
Long days
Long nights
And you just can't sleep Have you ever been so sure
That gave you cold feet
That felt all bare
And can feel your heart beat I never known this feeling never
Now I hope it stays and last forever
I am riding high
I don't want come down
But wings don't here me out
If I can touch the sky
"I risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Yeah Have you ever felt so lost
But didn't know until you were found
Looking everywhere
What you finally see know In the room full of people
Feel like no one's around
Got your head in the clouds
"And feet are off the ground Say I never knew this feeling, never"
Now I hope it stays and last forever
I am riding high
I don't want to come down
But wings don't hear me out
If I can touch the sky
"I risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
We get to go (Higher)
Higher
Higher
Higher
Higher I am riding high
Don't want to come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly I am riding high
Don't want to come down
But wings don't hear me out
If I can touch the sky
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah I cross the dryest desert
Just so came there to you
If I couldn't find you there
What in the world am I to do? 'Cause I won't lie
And I won't deceive you
So can't we try
To make it just like what we dreamed
"Hmm, yeah yeah yeah Devotion is my name"
"And I give myself to you, oh"
In this crazy world of mine
Your inspiration gets me through So I won't lie
And I won't deceive you
So can't we try
To make it just like what we dreamed
"Hmm, yeah yeah yeah In this whole world there's nothing I want more"
Than to give you all that you desire
To make your world a little brighter
There is nothing that I would not do (Crazy world of mine)
You make me rely true love
(Crazy world of mine)
"And I, I will make sure that it lasts"
(Crazy world of mine)
Just by dedicating all my time
(Crazy world of mine)
If you stay in this crazy world of mine

So can't we try
"(Yes we can, I know we can, I know we can)"
To make it just like what we dreamed
Just like what we dreaming
"Just like what we dreaming, yeah Now here's some loving for you, my darling"
I'll give you all of my time Sometimes I feel
Like I don't belong anywhere
And it's gonna take so long
For me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel
So heavy hearted
But I can't explain
Cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bare
"And it's a long, long way to heaven"
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Guide me In the morning when you wake
When I wanna face today and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever loose a faith and don't fall under In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all
"Through it all Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future"
Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day here will be another way
A chance to make it through In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all When you're down and out
Loosing dignity
Don't let go of me (hold on)
Surely there's is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realize
You don't have to cry (no more)
All you have to do is see
That you can believe in me
And I will never leave Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
Through it all Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Its just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
Oh oh Let's get away
Let's get away
Oh oh We can get away
We can get away
"Oh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are"
To be alive right now
"Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are"
To be alive right now
"Look around, look around Look at where you are"
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
"Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!"
That would be enough I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
"If you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative"
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
And this could be enough
"This would be enough Said, I would be enough"
And this could be enough
"See, we could be enough"
Oh baby I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Ooh Don't look no further
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough (I could be enough)
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (ay)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
"Listen, baby (Listen, baby)"
We can have it all (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah
"Woo So look around, look around at how lucky we are"
To be alive right now
"Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are"
To be alive right now
"Look around, look around"
Baby
Darling
Ooh Let's go back in time
When seeing your ID on mine
Made me crazy
Ooh baby I'm saying Let's go back there
Let's take it there
I'm talking bout
Back in time
When you wanted to know my every move
Tired to keep it smooth
Keepin' up with me
You drove me crazy oh baby Let's go back there
Let's take it there When you
Didn't know me
Didn't need me
I wanted to touch me
Couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how
Far it would go
I couldn't know if
This was for sure
We just could not
"We just could not get enough of it baby , let's go Have that wreckless love"
That crazy love
That off the wall won't stop til I get enough kind of love
I need that love
"So baby, let's go Have that wreckless love"
That crazy love
That I don't really care
We can have it anywhere
Kind of love
That wreckless love Let's go back in time
When our kiss was brand new
An adventure not perfected
A little hesitant Let's go back there
Let's take it there Take it back in time
"When forever was a minute, and eternity was a second"
I'm stressing that we have to go back there
Let's take it there. When you
Didn't know me
Didn't need me
I wanted to touch me
Couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how
Far it would go
I couldn't know if
This was for sure
We just could not

That off the wall won't stop til I get enough kind of love
I need that love
"So baby, let's go Every little bit hurts"
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
"Yeah, you won't let me go Every little hurt counts"
Every little hurt counts
You say you're coming home
Yet you'd never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you I can't take this loneliness you've given me
I can't go on giving my life away
Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you all the things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
"To you, I'm a toy"
And you're the boy
Who has to say
What I should play
"Yeah, you hurt me"
Desert me Come back to me
"Darling, you'll see"
I can give you all the things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts 
"Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away"
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
"Oh, I believe in yesterday Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be"
There's a shadow hanging over me.
"Oh, yesterday came suddenly Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say"
"I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play"
Now I need a place to hide away
"Oh, I believe in yesterday Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say"
"I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play"
Now I need a place to hide away
"Oh, I believe in yesterday"
"Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me"
"Speaking words of wisdom, let it be"
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
"Speaking words of wisdom, let it be"
"Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be"
"Whisper words of wisdom, let it be And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree"
"There will be an answer, let it be"
"For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see"
"There will be an answer, let it be"
"Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be"
"There will be an answer, let it be"
"Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be"
"Whisper words of wisdom, let it be"
"Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be"
"Whisper words of wisdom, let it be And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me"
"Shine until tomorrow, let it be"
"I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me"
"Speaking words of wisdom, let it be"
"Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be"
"There will be an answer, let it be"
"Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be"
"Whisper words of wisdom, let it be Words are flowing out like"
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me. Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
"Nothing's gonna change my world Images of broken light, which"
"Dance before me like a million eyes,"
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe. Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
"Nothing's gonna change my world Sounds of laughter, shades of life"
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
"Limitless undying love, which"
"Shines around me like a million suns,"
"It calls me on and on across the universe Jai Guru Deva, om."
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
"Jai Guru Deva Hey Jude, don't make it bad"
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
"Then you can start to make it better Hey Jude, don't be afraid"
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
"Then you begin to make it better And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain"
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Hey Jude, don't let me down"
"You have found her, now go and get her"
Remember to let her into your heart
"Then you can start to make it better So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin"
You're waiting for someone to perform with
"And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do"
The movement you need is on your shoulder
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah Hey Jude, don't make it bad"
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
"Better better better better better better, oh Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude There are places I'll remember"
"All my life, though some have changed"
"Some forever, not for better"
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
"In my life, I've loved them all But of all these friends and lovers"
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
"In my life, I love you more Though I know I'll never lose affection"
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
"In my life, I love you more"
In my life-- I love you more Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
"You were only waiting for this moment to be free Blackbird fly, blackbird fly"
"Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird fly, blackbird fly"
Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
"Here comes the sun, and I say"
"It's all right Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter"
"Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here"
Here comes the sun
"Here comes the sun, and I say"
"It's all right Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces"
"Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here"
Here comes the sun
"Here comes the sun, and I say"
"It's all right Sun, sun, sun, here it comes"
"Sun, sun, sun, here it comes"
"Sun, sun, sun, here it comes"

"and I will sing a lullaby Boy you're gonna carry that weight,"
carry that weight for a long time
"Boy you're gonna carry that weight,"
"carry that weight for a long time I never give you my pillow,"
I only send you my invitations
"And in the middle of the celebrations,"
"I break down Boy you're gonna carry that weight,"
carry that weight for a long time
"Boy you're gonna carry that weight,"
"carry that weight for a long time Oh yeah, all right,"

"Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you"
"Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you"
"Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you"
"Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you And in the end,"
"the love you take,"
"is equal to the love you make,"
"Ah Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love. There's nothing you can do that can't be done."
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
"Nothing you can say, but you can learn"
How to play the game
It's easy.
Nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
"Nothing you can do, but you can learn"
How to be you in time
"It's easy. All you need is love, all you need is love,"
"All you need is love, love. Love is all you need."
"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love."
"All you need is love, all you need is love,"
"All you need is love, love. Love is all you need. There's nothing you can know that isn't known."
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where
You're meant to be
"It's easy. All you need is love, all you need is love,"
"All you need is love, love. Love is all you need."
All you need is love. (All together now).
All you need is love. (Everybody).
"All you need is love, love. Love is all you need."
Love is all you need.
Love is all you need (Yesterday)
(Oh yeah)
"(She love you, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"(She love you, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"(Oh, yesterday) There are places I remember all my life"
Though some have changed
"Some forever, not for better"
Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments
Of lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I loved them all And with all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more
In my life I loved you more Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
"I think I know I mean a ""Yes"""
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand [Chorus]
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing [Chorus] In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band [Chorus] In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
"And in the evening he's a singer with the band [Chorus] And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now"
"Will you still be sending me a valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine?"
"If I'd been out 'til quarter to three, would you lock the door?"
"Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four? You'll be older too"
Ah
"And, if you say the word, I could stay with you I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone"
"You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride"
"Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?"
"Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four? Every summer we can rent a cottage"
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Ah
Grandchildren on your knee
"Vera, Chuck, and Dave Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view"
"Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely, wasting away"
"Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more"
"Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four? Oh yeah I tell you somethin'"
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand Oh please say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
"Now, let me hold your hand"
I want to hold your hand And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feelin' that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
"I can't hide Yeah, you got that somethin'"
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feelin' that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
"I can't hide Yeah, you got that somethin'"
I think you'll understand
When I feel that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
"I want to hold your hand Don't let me down, don't let me down"
"Don't let me down, don't let me down Nobody ever loved me like she does"
"Oh, she does, yeah, she does"
And if somebody loved me like she do me
"Oh, she do me, yes, she does Don't let me down, don't let me down"
"Don't let me down, don't let me down I'm in love for the first time"
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
"It's a love that had no past Don't let me down, don't let me down"
"Don't let me down, don't let me down And from the first time that she really done me"
"Oh, she done me, she done me good"
I guess nobody ever really done me
"Oh, she done me, she done me good Don't let me down, don't let me down"
"Don't let me down Help, I need somebody"
"Help, not just anybody"
"Help, you know I need someone, help When I was younger, so much younger than today"
I never needed anybody's help in any way
"But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured"
"Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors Help me if you can, I'm feeling down"
And I do appreciate you being round
"Help me, get my feet back on the ground"
"Won't you please, please help me And now my life has changed in oh so many ways"
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
"I know that I just need you like I've never done before Help me if you can, I'm feeling down"
And I do appreciate you being round
"Help me, get my feet back on the ground"
"Won't you please, please help me When I was younger, so much younger than today"
I never needed anybody's help in any way
"But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured"
"Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors Help me if you can, I'm feeling down"
And I do appreciate you being round
"Help me, get my feet back on the ground"
"Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh Something in the way she moves"
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how You're asking me will my love grow
"I don't know, I don't know"
You stick around and it may show
"I don't know, I don't know Something in the way she knows"
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how Here come old flat top

But I never heard them ringing
"No, I never heard them at all"
Till there was you There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
"No, I never saw them at all"
Till there was you Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
"No, I never heard it at all"
Till there was you
Till there was you You say you want a revolution
"Well, you know"
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
"Well, you know"
We all want to change the world But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be
"All right, all right, all right You say you got a real solution"
"Well, you know"
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
"Well, you know"
We're doing what we can But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be
"All right, all right, all right You say you'll change the constitution"
"Well, you know"
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
"Well, you know"
You better free you mind instead But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao

Don't you know it's gonna be
"All right, all right, all right"
"All right, all right, all right"
"All right, all right, all right"
"All right, all right In the town where I was born"
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine"
We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine And our friends are all aboard"
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine"
We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine (Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead"
"Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant."
"Cut the cable, drop the cable"
"Aye, Sir, aye"
"Captain, captain) As we live a life of ease"
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine"
We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine"
We all live in a yellow submarine
"Yellow submarine, yellow submarine Who knows how long I've loved you"
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
"If you want me to, I will And if I ever saw you"
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
"Oh, you know I will Love you forever and forever"
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart And when at last I found you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
All the things you do endear you to me
"Oh, you know I will"
"Oh, you know I will"
"Oh, you know I will"
"Oh, you know I will What would you think if I sang out of tune"
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
"And I'll try not to sing out of key Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends What do I do when my love is away"
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day
"Are you sad because you're on your own? No, I get by with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends Do you need anybody?"
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love Would you believe in a love at first sight?
"Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time"
What do you see when you turn out the light?
"I can't tell you, but I know it's mine Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends Do you need anybody?"
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
"I want somebody to love Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends"
"Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends"
"Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends"
"Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends"
With a little help from my friends I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together

"Set you down father, rest you) I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping"
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you. I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you. I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
"Still my guitar gently weeps. Oh yeah, all right"
"Are you gonna be in my dreams tonight? Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"

"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you"
"Love you, love you And in the end, the love you take"
"Is equal to the love you make I read the news today, oh boy"
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
"If he was from the House of Lords I saw a film today, oh boy"
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
"I'd love to turn you on Woke up, fell out of bed"
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
"Somebody spoke and I went into a dream I read the news today, oh boy"
"Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire"
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
"I'd love to turn you on Michelle, ma belle"
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
"Michelle, ma belle"
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
"I love you, I love you, I love you"
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
"I will say the only words I know that you'll understand Michelle, ma belle"
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
"I need to, I need to, I need to"
I need to make you see
"Oh, what you mean to me"
"Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean"
"I love you... I want you, I want you, I want you"
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
"Until I do, I'm telling you so you'll understand"
"Michelle, ma belle"
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
"Stop and say ""Hello"". On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,"
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
"In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes."
There beneath the blue suburban skies
"I sit, and meanwhile back"
"In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,"
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
"He likes to keep his fire engine clean,"
It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
"And though she feels as if she's in a play,"
"She is anyway. In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,"
"We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,"
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
"I sit, and meanwhile back."
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane! Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner

Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling

"To get back home Sleep, pretty darling"
Do not cry

Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh Because the wind is high it blows my mind
"Because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh Love is old, love is new"
"Love is all, love is you Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry"
Because the sky is blue...aaaaaaahhhh Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh... Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
"Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly"
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and look so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
"Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair"
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
"Man, junior, behave yourself Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand"
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
"Well, he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop"
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
"Well, this rock and roll has got to stop"
Junior's head is hard as rock
"Now junior, behave yourself Going tell your mama you better do what she said"
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
He took your canary and he fed it to the neighbors cat
He gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
"Well, mama's head has got to stop"
Junior's head is hard as rock
"Now junior, behave yourself I give her all my love"
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die

Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
It's time for bed She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
"Isn't it good Norwegian wood? Well, shake it up baby now"
Twist and shout
"Come on, come on, come, come on baby now"
Come on and work it on out
"Well, work it on out, honey"
You know you look so good
You know you got me goin' now
"Just like I know you would Well, shake it up baby now"
Twist and shout
"Come on, come on, come, come on baby now"
Come on and work it on out
"You know you twist, little girl"
You know you twist so fine
Come on and twist a little closer now
"And let me know that you're mine, woo Ah, ah, ah, ah, wow"
Baby now
Twist and shout
"Come on, come on, come, come on baby now"
Come on and work it on out
"You know you twist, little girl"
You know you twist so fine
Come on and twist a little closer now
And let me know that you're mine
"Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now"
"Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now"
"Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby now"
"Ah, ah, ah, ah She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah You think you've lost your love"
"Well, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay"
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say-yi-yay She says she loves you
and you know that can't be bad
"Yes, she loves you"
and you know you should be glad She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind

"Yes, she loves you"
"and you know you should be glad Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"

Apologize to her Because she loves you

"Ah look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice"
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
"Waits at the window, wearing the face"
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
"Where do they all belong? Father McKenzie, writing the words"
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
"Look at him working, darning his socks"
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Ah look at all the lonely people
"Ah look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby, died in the church"
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
"Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt"
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
"So how could I dance with another,"
"Oh, when I saw her standing there Well she looked at me"
"And I, I could see"
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
"Oh, when I saw her standing there Well my heart went boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another

When I'm sixty-four.
"You'll be older too,"
"And if I say the word,"
I could stay with you.
"I could be handy, mending a fuse"
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
"Sunday morning go for a ride,"
"Doing the garden, digging the weeds,"
Who could ask for more.
"Will you still need me, will you still feed me"
When I'm sixty-four.
"Every summer we can rent a cottage,"

The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. To lead a better life
"I need my love to be here Here, making each day of the year"
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
"There, running my hands through her hair"
Both of us thinking how good it can be
"Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there I want her everywhere"
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there I will be there
And everywhere
"Here, there and everywhere I've just seen a face,"
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
"We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm Had it been another day"
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
"Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di. Falling, yes I am falling,"
And she keeps calling
Me back again. I have never known
"The like of this, I've been alone"
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
"Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di. Falling, yes I am falling,"
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Yeah!
"Bup-a-lup-bup! Falling, yes I am falling,"
And she keeps calling
"Me back again. I've just seen a face,"
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
"We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di. Falling, yes I am falling,"
And she keeps calling
"Me back again. Falling, yes I am falling,"
And she keeps calling
"Me back again. Oh, falling, yes I am falling,"
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today... Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
"And no religion, too Imagine all the people"
"Living life in peace You, you may say I'm a dreamer"
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people
"Sharing all the world You, you may say I'm a dreamer"
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
"Lead me to your door Oh, I need your love, babe"
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
"Just like I need you Hold me, love me, hold me, love me"
"I ain't got nothing but love, babe"
"Eight days a week Love you every day, girl"
Always on my mind
"One thing I can say, girl"
"Love you all the time Hold me, love me, hold me, love me"
"I ain't got nothing but love, girl"
Eight days a week Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
"Is not enough to show I care Ooh I need your love, babe"
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
"Just like I need you Hold me, love me, hold me, love me"

"Love you all the time Hold me, love me, hold me, love me"
"I ain't got nothing but love, babe"
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Eight days a week Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
"Ah, girl, girl, girl When I think of all the times"
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
"Ah, girl, girl, girl She's the kind of girl who puts you down"
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
"She's cool, ooh, oo, oo, oo"
"Girl, girl, girl Was she told when she was young"
That pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead
"Ah, girl, girl, girl"
Girl I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
"He'd let us in, knows where we've been"
In his octopus' garden in the shade I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade. We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe) We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you. One two three four

I'll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her 'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
"If I fell in love with you I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink"
"I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink"
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
"No, no, no I'm so tired, I don't know what to do"
"I'm so tired, my mind is set on you"
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do You'd say I'm putting you on
"But it's no joke, it's doing me harm"
"You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain"
"You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane"
You know I'd give you everything I've got
"For a little peace of mind I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset"
"Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette"
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get You'd say I'm putting you on
"But it's no joke, it's doing me harm"
"You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain"
"You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane"
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'd give you everything I've got
"For a little peace of mind Sheepdog, standing in the rain"
"Bullfrog, doing it again"
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
To listen to your fears You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
"If you're lonely, you can talk to me Big man (yeah) walking in the park"
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you
"You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue You can talk to me"
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
"If you're lonely, you can talk to me Hey hey Roar Hey, bulldog (hey bulldog) Woof Hey, bulldog"

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Oh You Never Give Me Your Money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
"Out of college, money spent"
"See no future, pay no rent"
"All the money's gone, nowhere to go"
Any jobber got the sack
"Monday morning, turning back"
"Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go"
"But, oh, that magic feeling"
Nowhere to go
"Oh, that magic feeling"
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Ah Ah Ah
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
"Yes it did (na, na)"

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
"Shaves in the dark, tryin to save paper"
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in the shop
She never stops; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
"Well, you should see Polythene Pam"
"She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man"
"Well, you should see her in drag"
Dressed in her polythene bag
"Yes, you should see Polythene Pam"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
"Yes, you could say that she's attractively built"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
(John) She's coming in the house
"(Paul) Oh, look out!"
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
"Well, I knew what I could not say"
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
"She could steal, but she could not rob"
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
"Oh, yeah"
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
"Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry"
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
"Sleep pretty darling, do not cry"
And I will sing a lullaby.
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
"Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry"
And I will sing a lullaby
"Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight"
Carry That Weight a long time
"Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight"

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
"Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight"
Carry That Weight a long time
"Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight"
Carry That Weight a long time

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
"He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy"""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
"Rocky had come, equipped with a gun"
To shoot off the legs of his rival
"His rival it seems, had broken his dreams"
By stealing the girl of his fancy
"Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil"
But everyone knew her as Nancy
"Now she and her man, who called himself Dan"
Were in the next room at the hoe down
"Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin"
"He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown"""
"But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot"
"And Rocky collapsed in the corner Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin"
And proceeded to lie on the table
"He said, ""Rocky, you met your match"""
"And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch"
"And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"" Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room"
Only to find Gideon's Bible
"Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt"
"To help with good Rocky's revival Try to see it my way,"
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
"While you see it your way,"
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
"We can work it out,"
We can work it out Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
"Think of what I'm saying,"
"We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night"
"We can work it out,"
"We can work it out Life is very short, and there's no time"
"For fussing and fighting, my friend"
"I have always thought that it's a crime,"
So I will ask you once again
"Try to see it my way,"
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
"We can work it out,"

Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
"Oh, oh, oh, oh. Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,"
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,"
"Joa, oa, oa, oan?"" But as she's getting ready to go,"
A knock comes on the door. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead. Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
"Sce, e, e, ene, She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,"
So he waits behind
"Writing fifty times ""I must not be"
"So, o, o, o"" But when she turns her back on the boy,"
He creeps up from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
"Made sure that she was dead. P. C. Thirty-one said, ""We caught a dirty one."""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
"Oh, oh, oh, oh. Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery"
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
"So, o, o, o. But as the words are leaving his lips,"
A noise comes from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
"Made sure that he was dead. Whoa, oh, oh, oh."
Silver hammer man Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away How can I even try?
I can never win
"Hearing them, seeing them"
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way?
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away Last night I said these words to my girl
"I know you never even try, girl"
"Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on)"
"Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you You don't need me to show the way, love"

"Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on)"
"Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you I don't want to sound complaining"
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you
It's so hard to reason with you
"Woah yeah, why do you make me blue? Last night I said these words to my girl"
"I know you never even try, girl"
"Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on)"

"Me, woah yeah, like I please you"
"Me, woah yeah, like I please you Let me tell you how it will be"
"There's one for you, nineteen for me"

"If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat."
"If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,"

If you don't want to pay some more

Declare the pennies on your eyes
"'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman"

"(Madly in love) Babe, you are the reason to breathe"
"And babe, you know you're all that I need"
Remember when you took my hand

And wandered off to Chinatown
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
When I look into your eyes It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
"Madly in love, yeah"
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love

Where'd the love go?
"Where's the passion, oh?"
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken [Pre-Chorus]
"You know the truth, babe"
"What should I do, babe?"
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all [Chorus]
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh"
"I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh"
"Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh"
"I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh"
With you with you oh without you [Verse 2]
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
"You got me open, now we are broken"
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all (at all) [Chorus]
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh"
"I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh"
"Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh"
"I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh"
With you with you oh without you [Verse 3]
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
"If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?"
"If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?"
"It's all good, it's all g"
"'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me"
"In the meantime, girls be around me"
"And I was so lost, until you found me"
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you"
"I'm doing better without you, you, you [Chorus]"
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh (so much better)"
"I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh (woah)"
"Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, trippin on you, trippin on you)"
"I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, tripping on you)"
With you with you oh without you [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
"Don't text, take a deep breath"
"'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey"
"Baby, don't stress"
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
So when I invite you
"Baby don't shy, oh"
"Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling"
"Show of, when you come closer"
"Don't waste no time, I need it every minute darling"
"Oh, believe in me"
Guaranteeing in my loyalty
How many times you don't want me to leave?
"Want me to leave, no [Chorus]"
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
"Don't text, take a deep breath"
"'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey"
"Baby, don't stress"
Stress out over me [Verse 2]
"Oh, oh, no"
Let's take it slow
From the bottom to the top to (?)
No need to turn up
Like the echo from your voice set the world shook
Every (?) will achieve
Don't hesitate to follow my lead
How many times you don't want me to leave?
"You don't want me to leave, no [Chorus]"
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)
I'm the only guy that you need (I'm the only guy that you need)
And there's a viable term in me
"Said you want this, want this"
"Don't text, don't text, take a deep breath, take a deep breath"
'Cause I don't need you to stress
"I don't need you to stress out over me, hey hey"
Stress out over me
"Baby, don't stress over me Come on over in my direction"
"So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah"
"Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah"
"Oh, you are"
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
"Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly"
"You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on"
"Got the only key, know how to turn it on"
"The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear"
"Baby take it slow so we can last long Oh, tÃº, tÃº eres el imÃ¡n y yo soy el metal"
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
SÃ³lo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
"Oh, yeah Ya, ya me estÃ¡ gustando mÃ¡s de lo normal"
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mÃ¡s
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningÃºn apuro Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oÃ­do
Para que te acuerdes si no estÃ¡s conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
"(Sube, sube, sube"
"Sube, sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo"
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
"(Favorito, favorito, baby)"
DÃ©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
"Y que olvides tu apellido Si te pido un beso, ven, dÃ¡melo"
Yo sÃ© que estÃ¡s pensÃ¡ndolo
Llevo tiempo intentÃ¡ndolo
"Mami, esto es dando y dÃ¡ndolo"
"Sabes que tu corazÃ³n conmigo te hace bom, bom"
"Sabes que esa beba estÃ¡ buscando de mi bom, bom"
"Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cÃ³mo te sabe"
"Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuÃ¡nto amor a ti te cabe"
"Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje"
"Empecemos lento, despuÃ©s salvaje Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito"
"Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito"
Cuando tÃº me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
"Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito"
"Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito"
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquÃ­ tengo la pieza
Â¡Oye! Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oÃ­do
Para que te acuerdes si no estÃ¡s conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
"(Sube, sube, sube"
"Sube, sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo"
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
"(Favorito, favorito, baby)"
DÃ©jame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido Despacito

"I just wanna hear you screaming, ""Â¡Ay, Bendito!"""
I can move forever cuando estÃ© contigo
"Â¡Bailalo! Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito"
"Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito"
Que le enseÃ±es a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
"(Favorito, favorito, baby)"
"Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito"
"Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito"
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)
Despacito What do you mean?
"Oh, oh, oh"
When you sometimes say yes
But you sometimes say no

"Hey, yeah"
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh

Said you're running out of time
What do you mean?
"Oh, oh, oh"
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
"What do you mean? You're so indecisive, what I'm saying"
"Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart"
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end
Where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right (ooh)
"Wanna argue all day, hangin' out all night (oh)"
"First you're up, then you're down and in between"
"Oh, I really want to know What do you mean?"

What do you mean?
"Oh, what do you mean?"
Said you're running out of time
What do you mean?
"Oh, oh, oh"
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean? You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
"You had me from the start, won't let this end"
"First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right"
"Wanna argue all day, hangin' out all night"
"First you're up, then you're down and in between"
"Oh, I really wanna know What do you mean?"
"Oh, oh, oh"
When you sometimes say yes

Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
"Oh, oh, oh (this is ours baby, yeah)"

What do you mean? (you're so confusing baby)
"Hey, yeah"

"Oh, oh, oh"
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
"What do you mean? Ooh, ooh"
"Ooh, ooh"
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
"I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?"
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight"
"'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
"Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?"
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
"Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? Ooh, ooh"
"I'm sorry, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Sorry, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh"
Sorry
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
"Ooh, ooh I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to"
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
"I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth"
"Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
"Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?"
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? I'm not just trying to get you back on me
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
"Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? Ooh, ooh"
"I'm sorry, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Sorry, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh"
Sorry

"Ooh, ooh"
"I'm sorry, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Sorry, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh"
Sorry
"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? Oh Whoa
Oh Whoa
"Oh Whoa You know you love me, I know you care"
"Just shout whenever, and I'll be there"
"You are my love, you are my heart"
"And we will never, ever , ever be apart Are we an item? Girl, quit playing"
"Were just friends, what are you saying"
"Said ""there's another,"" and looked right in my eyes"
"My first love broke my heart for the first time And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"I thought you'd always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, no"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"I thought you'd always be mine, mine For you, I would have done whatever"
And I just can't believe we aren't together
"And I want to play it cool, but I'm losing you"
"I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you diamond ring And I'm in pieces, baby fix me"
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
"I'm going down, down, down, down"
"And I just can't believe my first love won't be around And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, no"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"I thought you'd always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, no"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"I thought you'd always be mine, mine When I was 13, I had my first love"
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us who could ever come above
"She had me going crazy, oh I was starstruck"
"She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks She made my heart pound"
I skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground
But I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
"And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying Baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, no"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"I thought you'd always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh"
"Like baby, baby, baby, no"
"Like baby, baby, baby, oh"
"I thought you'd always be mine, mine I'm all gone"
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Now I'm all gone
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Now I'm all gone
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone"
I'm gone For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
"You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake"
"You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care"
"I don't but, you still hit my phone up"
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
"I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that"
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
"And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on"
"And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much"
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
"I don't but, you still hit my phone up"
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
"I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that"
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
"And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on"
"And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much"
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself For all the times you made me feel small
"I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all"
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself We The Best Music

"Me plus you, I'm a tell you one time One time"
One time My friends say I'm a fool
To think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cause honestly the truth is
That you know I'm never leavin'
'Cause you're my angel sent from above Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
"Give you little more because I love ya, love ya"
"With me, girl, is where you belong"
Just stay right here
"I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya Love me, love me"
Say that you love me

"Fool me, fool me"
"Oh, how you do me"
"Kiss me, kiss me"
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
"A thousand days without your love, oh your love Oh, baby you can do no wrong"
My money is yours
"Give you little more because I love ya, love ya"
"With me, girl, is where you belong"
Just stay right here

"Tell me you love me You've got that smile,"
That only heaven can make.
"I pray to God everyday,"
"That you keep that smile. Yeah, you are my dream,"
There's not a thing I won't do.
"I'll give my life up for you,"
"'Cause you are my dream. And baby, everything that I have is yours,"
You will never go cold or hungry.
"I'll be there when you're insecure,"
Let you know that you're always lovely.
"Girl, 'cause you are,"
"The only thing that I got right now One day when the sky is falling,"
"I'll be standing right next to you,"
Right next to you.
"Nothing will ever come between us,"
"'Cause I'll be standing right next to you,"
Right next to you.
"You had my child,"
You would make my life complete.
"Just to have your eyes on little me,"
"That'd be mine forever. And baby, everything that I have is yours"
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely
"Girl, 'cause you are,"
"The only thing that I got right now One day when the sky is falling,"
"I'll be standing right next to you,"
Right next to you.
"Nothing will ever come between us,"

To keep you forever.

oh-oh-oh-ohh I keep thinking in my head that one day we'll separate
"I see it happening everyday, nothing lasts forever"
That's what people say
I can't picture you out of my life
I think about this every day and night
And I don't know why but it seems to get to me
"No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone"
"So I'm staying with you till you want me to go Girl, you don't understand what you do to me"
"Got crazy in my head, I don't think I can leave"
I need you here with me all night
"Girl, I can't live without your smile"
"I'm in love, I don't know what to do"
But I'm crazy over you
"I'm in love, I don't know what to do"
But I'm crazy over you
"I'm in love, I don't know what to do"
But I'm crazy over you
"I'm, I'm in love I'm so scared to lose you"
"Uuh, uh, oh oh"
Don't know what I would do
Thought of me being replaced
Brings tears right to my face
And I can't think of anybody who would take your place
"No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone"
"So I'm staying with you till you want me to go Girl, you don't understand what you do to me"
"Got crazy in my head, I don't think I can leave"
I need you here with me all night
"Girl, I can't live without your smile"
"I'm in love, I don't know what to do"
But I'm crazy over you

But I'm crazy over you
"I'm in love, I don't know what to do"
But I'm crazy over you
"I'm, I'm in love Ended up on a crossroad"
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living"
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
"People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in"
Life is worth living again Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
"He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last"
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living"
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
"People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in"
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
"I ain't perfect, won't deny"
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me Life is worth living
"Life is worth living, so live another day"
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again Just a fraction of your love
Fills the air
And I fall in love with you
"All over again, woo woo woo"
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
"The only thing that would hurt me,"
"Is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation"
You understand what I'm sayin'?
"Girl, without you I'm lost"
Can't face this compass at heart
"Between me and love,"
You're the common denominator
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Common denominator
"Oh, yeah, woa Before you're love was low"
Playing girls was my high
We chase the game that would put
"My cot in the side, aye"
"When broken hearts rise up to say,"
Love is a lie
"You and I would stand to be love's reply Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah"
"The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation"
You understand what I'm sayin'?
"Girl, without you I'm lost"
Can't face this compass at heart
"Between me and love,"
You're the common denominator
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Common denominator
"Oh, yeah, woa I can't imagine life without your touch"
"And every kiss that you give, can fill me up"
And to all the heart aching
Jealous females hatin'
"Imma hold it down for you, you"
"You, woah, oh, woah"
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah woah I don't wanna go back
I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
"Girl, without you I'm lost"
Can't face this compass at heart
"Between me and love,"
You're the common denominator
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Common denominator
"Oh, yeah, woa Just a fraction of your love fills the air"
"And I fall in love with you all over again Can we, we keep, keep each other company"
"Maybe we, can be, be each other's company"
Oh company Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
"Never been around no press, ain't that serious Can we, we keep, keep each other company"
"Maybe we, can be, be each other's company"
Oh company It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
"Oh, don't miss out on us"
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
"Never been around no press, ain't that serious no Can we, we keep, keep each other company"
"Maybe we, can be, be each other's company"
"Oh company Can be, can be, be each other's company"
Be each other's company
Just be each other's company
"Be each others company Can we, we keep, keep each other company"
"Maybe we, can be, be each other's company"
"Oh company Ooh no, ooh no, ooh"
They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby give me one last hug There's a dream
That I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
"(Reality, reality)"
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand
That it's meant to be Cause baby when you're with me
"It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven"
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)
Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(Don't want you to go oh no so) Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cause this life's to long
And this love's to strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go I got my favorite girl
Not feelin' no pain or fear

"Oh no, don't have a care in the world"
"Why would I, when you are here"
"(You are here, you are here)"
There's a moment I've been chasin'
And I finally caught it out on this floor
"(On this floor, in this floor) Baby, there's no hesitation,"
No reservation by taking a chance and more
"Oh no, because It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven"
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)
Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better

"Watch my feet, follow me"
"Don't be scared, girl I'm here"
"If you didn't know, this is love (Let the music blast)"
(We gon' do our dance)

(And it's much to strong)
(So baby no for sure)
That I'll never let you go
"(I'll never let you go) So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing"

Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you've blessed me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
"Yeah, you've given me purpose Thinking my journey's come to an end, oh"
Sending out a farewell to my friends
Forever peace

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
"You give me purpose in every way Oh, you are my everything"
"Oh, you are my everything I don't know if this is wrong"
Because someone else is telling me that it's wrong
"But I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again"
We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given
So you have to understand that these like
That's not who you are
You know you're trying to be the best you can be
But that's all you can do
"If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself"
Give it all you got
"But if it ends up happening, it ends up happening"
That's what it's that's what's happening with me
It's like God I'm giving it all I got
Sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it
And it's like I'm not giving myself grace
"I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is Alright, let's go"

So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
"When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel"
"Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real"
"Act like you know me, but you never will"
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
"I'll show you I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way"
"Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing"
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
"When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel"
"Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real"
"Act like you know me, but you never will"
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you

I'll show you
"'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel"
"Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real"
"Act like you know me, but you never will"
But there's one thing that I know for sure I'll show you
"I'll show you Lately I've been thinking,thinking about what we had"
"And I know it was hard, it was all that we knew,yeah! Have you been drinking, to take all the pain away?"
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
"'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you"
"Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah! You know there's no one, I can relate to"
I know we won't find a love that's so true There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
"There's nothing like you for me, together I gave you everything babe"
"Well, everything I had to give"
"Girl, why would you push me away? Lost in confusion, like an illusion"
"You know I'm used to making your day But that is the past now, we didn't last now"
"I guess that this is meant to be Tell me, was it worth it? We were so perfect"
But baby I just want you to see There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
"There's nothing like you and me, together There's nothing like us"
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
"There's nothing like you and me, together You got a fast car"
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
"I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car"
"We go cruising, entertain ourselves"
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
"I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car"
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
"I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car"
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision

We're just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)
"And we'll cry, and cry, and cry, and cry"
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)
"And we try, and try, and try, and try So it's up to you and it's up to me"

Oh oh oh
And I pray I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
"Its in the papers, its on the TV,"
Its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
"I close my eyes and pray I lose my appetite,"
Knowing kids starve tonight
"Am I a sinner,"
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
"Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference"
And its starting today 'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
Pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray
Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change? I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
"When she's around, he feels nothing but joy"
"But she was already broken, and it made her blind"
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
"I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile"
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love"
"But you can't fly unless you let yourself,"
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
"'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone,"
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love"
"But you can't fly unless you let yourself,"

I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your

Full of beautiful instead of hollow
"Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill"
"Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?"
Or am I in love with the feeling?
"Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth"
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
"Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me"
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
"In love with you, am I in love with you?"
Or am I in love with the feeling? (Oh) (Oh) You give to me

And at least that's what it seems

"Oh across the ocean, across the sea"
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
"Over the mountains, across the sky,"
"Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes"

Don't you worry
"'Cause everything's gonna be alright,"
"Be alright Through the sorrow, and the fights"
Don't you worry
"'Cause everything's gonna be alright, [Verse 1]"
Where'd the love go?
"Where's the passion, oh?"
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken [Pre-Chorus]
"You know the truth, babe"
"What should I do, babe?"
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all [Chorus]
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh"
"I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh"
"Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh"
"I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh"
With you with you oh without you [Verse 2]
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
"You got me open, now we are broken"
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all (at all) [Chorus]
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh"
"I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh"
"Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh"
"I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh"
With you with you oh without you [Verse 3]
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
"If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?"
"If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?"
"It's all good, it's all g"
"'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me"
"In the meantime, girls be around me"
"And I was so lost, until you found me"
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you"
"I'm doing better without you, you, you [Chorus]"
"I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh (so much better)"
"I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh (woah)"
"Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, trippin on you, trippin on you)"
"I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, tripping on you)"
With you with you oh without you Girl you don't know how I feel
Since you been away oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call?
If you got you today
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
"Been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you'll pick up your phone"
"And I know that I don't wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby"
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone

Any chance that you could stay right here?
And never go away?
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
"Been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you'll pick up your phone"
"And I know that I don't wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby"
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
Baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart's breaking
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
"'Cause girl my heart's breaking (heart is breaking) So what I'm really tryin' to say is, and what I hope you understand"
Is despite all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
"I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around,"
"But this is, this is personal, this is for me and you"
And I want you to know that I still love you
"And I know the seasons may change,"
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that
I still believe in us
I still believe in love
I still believe in us
I hope you believe in love
"The way I believe in us You don't see, is what you don't see, is when we don't speak"
"Or really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya"
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feelin' the way that I'm feelin'
"I wanna know if you feelin' the way that I, the way that I"
"You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart"
"You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart"
"Be careful with your heart Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky"
I need you to shine in the light
"Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time"
Better believe it
"Uh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence"
"It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah"
"So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night"
"'Til you're back again, yeah, yeah You think I'm biased"
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
"But the next day bothers you, I You're all that matters to me"
"Yeah yeah, ain't worried about nobody else"
"If it ain't you, I'm not myself"

"When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you"

Faithful no matter the distance

"Oh, my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away, it's so empty"
And love don't make no sense when it's empty (Oh no)

Wishin' I could just wash away
Away
And our love was in vain
"Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known"
If I would have known it could have been you
"If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new"
"I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant"
"Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known"
If I would have known it could have been you
"Been you There are percussions, I'm missing your loving"
"Must be the night, the ghost of a life"
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time Like a permanent stain
Wishin' I could just wash away
Away
Hate or love was insane
"Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known"
If I would have known it could have been you
"If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new"
"I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant"
"Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known"
If I would have known it could have been you

If I would have known it could have been you
Been you [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
"Don't text, take a deep breath"
"'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey"
"Baby, don't stress"
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
So when I invite you
"Baby don't shy, oh"
"Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling"
"Show of, when you come closer"
"Don't waste no time, I need it every minute darling"
"Oh, believe in me"
Guaranteeing in my loyalty
How many times you don't want me to leave?
"Want me to leave, no [Chorus]"
You're the only girl that I see

And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this

"'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey"
"Baby, don't stress"
Stress out over me [Verse 2]
"Oh, oh, no"
Let's take it slow
From the bottom to the top to (?)
No need to turn up
Like the echo from your voice set the world shook
Every (?) will achieve
Don't hesitate to follow my lead
How many times you don't want me to leave?
"You don't want me to leave, no [Chorus]"
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)
I'm the only guy that you need (I'm the only guy that you need)
And there's a viable term in me
"Said you want this, want this"
"Don't text, don't text, take a deep breath, take a deep breath"
'Cause I don't need you to stress
"I don't need you to stress out over me, hey hey"
Stress out over me
"Baby, don't stress over me Believe, believe, believe I don't know how I got here"
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now 'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
"Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe"
"Believe There were days when I was just broken, you know"
There were nights when I was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from foldin'

And just look at us now 'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
"Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe Where would I be, if you, if you"
If you didn't believe
"Would you know, how it feels"
"To touch the sky, if you didn't believe"
"Believe, believe, yeah It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor"
You knew one day I would be standing tall
And just look at us now 'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing

"To touch the sky, yeah if you didn't believe"
"(Believe, believe) where would I be, if you didn't believe Happy birthday You ain't gotta question it"
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in what she say'll have you livid
Know they won't be happy 'til our love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it They ain't never had your back like how I got it
They ain't never had a chance how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it

The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are

The raining of equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
"Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em They ain't never had my back like you got it"
They ain't never had a chance how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it

"And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good"""
They only get as close as you allow them to
"We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather"
"Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever"
"I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer"
"History sweater, serendipity when you with me"
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
"Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home"
"I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole forty-two"
"I've accomplished my goals, it's only you"
"You and I in that wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape"
"Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight, Esco Don't question it"
You ain't gotta question it (oh)

"tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends"
when you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
"i could tell, i could tell, i could tell"
certain people don't like me no more

"uh, you can look me in my eyes and see i ain't myself"
cause if y'all what i created then i hate myself
"but still, let them girls in and tell them all"
leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
"i'm all day with it man, a.m to the p.m"

Close to you
You... You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? don't nobody deserve myself
"Oh no, baby what I'm saying is You ain't gotta make your mind up"
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"Calm down, don't rush, no pressure Thought that you were in it for the paper"
Never thought I'd take you serious
"Now I need you, not a moment later"
"Losin' it, I'm so delirious"
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
"Don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
"Don't rush, no pressure Put my key in the ignition"
"Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me"
I know that you ain't got no plans to leave
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
"Don't do it, baby"
"Don't do it to me, no I know you don't wanna talk, right"
We've been on and off like the crosslights
"You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?"
"When I touch you, I get frostbite"
"Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold"
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
"You're supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono"
"Oh no, round two again"
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
"I learned my lesson, I got straight As"
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
"Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious"
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
"Don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"Right now, don't rush, no pressure"
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
"Don't rush, no pressure You ain't gotta make your mind up right now"
I know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
"Don't rush, no pressure Looking out the window"
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
"You should be here with me, safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe"
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
'Cept for the clock on the wall
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm
"You should be here with me, safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe"
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I till Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
"More than just to have you here, whoa"
I'll be waiting I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight That's this..
Can't sit in my room alone
"I can't eat, I can't sleep"

Cause you're not here with me

"Because, because people aren't perfect and"
"By not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people"
"And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints"
"So I, I just get my recognition from Him"
"And give Him recognition Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I won't let the night stand in my way yeah"

Put our all in it
"Don't want to be left with the questions, why"
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain yeah? Sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is
Listen to your deepest feelings they don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
They don't wanna see us together now
"'Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah If I believe in love"
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now Growing pains come along with these changes
"Some people get closer some people separate, yeah"
Don't think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That's what we ought to do
Yeah Sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is
Listen to your deepest feelings they don't ever lie

My mind never wakes up without you on it
"And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams"
Is this meant to be?
"Could this be happening to me, yeah?"
We were best of friends since we were this high
"So why do I get nervous every time you, walk by?"
We would be on the phone all day
"Now I can't find the words to say, to you"
Now what am I supposed to do? Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
"It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us"
"Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough"
"They say we're too young for love, but I'm"
Catching feelings

"I'm good alone, but with you I'm better"
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll
Be right there (be right there)

'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get at the mirror
"And say it to her, yeah Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up"
"It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us"
"Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough"
"They say we're too young for love, but I'm"
Catching feelings
Catching feelings girl Should I tell her how I really feel? (How I really feel?)
Or should I move in close or just be still? (How will I know?)
"'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand, will everything change?"
"How do I know, if she feels the same, woah Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up"
"It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us"
"Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough"

"Love you I know that you afraid, babe"

"Show me where you at, let's keep it honest"
Home is where you at and that's a promise

"Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta"
"Tell me who created you, I'd thank her"

"			There must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief"
"Theres too much confusion, I cant get no relief"
"Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth
"No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke"
There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
"But you and I, weve been through that, and this is not our fate"
"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late"
"All along the watchtower, princes kept the view"
"While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too"
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
"Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl										 "
"			Once upon a time you dressed so fine"
"You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didnt you?"
"Peopled call, say, Beware doll, youre bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin out
Now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
"Youve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely"
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out youre gonna have to get used to it
You said youd never compromise
"With the mystery tramp, but now you realize"
Hes not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it aint no good
You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Aint it hard when you discover that
He really wasnt where its at
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
"Theyre drinkin, thinkin that they got it made"
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
"But youd better lift your diamond ring, youd better pawn it babe"
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
"Go to him now, he calls you, you cant refuse"
"When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose"
"Youre invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal"
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
"Like a rolling stone?										 "
"			Oh God said to Abraham, Kill me a son"
"Abe says, Man, you must be puttin me on"
"God say, No. Abe say, What?"
"God say, You can do what you want Abe, but"
The next time you see me comin you better run
"Well Abe says, Where do you want this killin done?"
"God says, Out on Highway 61"
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldnt give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said theres only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Ol Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings"
And a thousand telephones that dont ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things werent right
My complexion she said is much too white
"He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm youre right"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61
Now the rovin gambler he was very bored
He was tryin to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
Well just put some bleachers out in the sun
"And have it on Highway 61										 "
"			Early one mornin the sun was shinin"
I was layin in bed
Wondrin if shed changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mamas homemade dress
Papas bankbook wasnt big enough
And I was standin on the side of the road
Rain fallin on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows Ive paid some dues gettin through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
"I helped her out of a jam, I guess"
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin away
I heard her say over my shoulder
Well meet again someday on the avenue
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin for a while on a fishin boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
"But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew"
Tangled up in blue
She was workin in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
Is just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
"Said to me, Dont I know your name?"
I muttered somethin underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought youd never say hello, she said"
You look like the silent type
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin coal
Pourin off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now Im goin back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
Theyre an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters wives
Dont know how it all got started
I dont know what theyre doin with their lives
"But me, Im still on the road"
Headin for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
"Tangled up in blue										 "
"			How many roads must a man walk down"
Before you call him a man?
"Yes, n how many seas must a white dove sail"
Before she sleeps in the sand?
"Yes, n how many times must the cannonballs fly"
Before theyre forever banned?
"The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind"
The answer is blowin in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before its washed to the sea?
"Yes, n how many years can some people exist"
Before theyre allowed to be free?
"Yes, n how many times can a man turn his head"
Pretending he just doesnt see?
"The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind"
The answer is blowin in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
"Yes, n how many ears must one man have"
Before he can hear people cry?
"Yes, n how many deaths will it take till he knows"
That too many people have died?
"The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind"
"The answer is blowin in the wind										 "
"			You walk into the room"
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
"And you say, Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you dont understand
Just what youll say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?"
You raise up your head
"And you ask, Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
Its his
"And you say, Whats mine?"
"And somebody else says, Where what is?"
"And you say, Oh my God"
Am I here all alone?
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?"
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
"And says, How does it feel"
To be such a freak?
"And you say, Impossible"
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?"
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
Youve been with the professors
And theyve all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
Youve been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgeralds books
Youre very well read
Its well known
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?"
"Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you"
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
"And he says, Here is your throat back"
Thanks for the loan
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?"
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word NOW
"And you say, For what reason?"
"And he says, How?"
"And you say, What does this mean?"
"And he screams back, Youre a cow"
Give me some milk
Or else go home
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?"
"Well, you walk into the room"
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin around
You should be made
To wear earphones
Because something is happening here
But you dont know what it is
"Do you, Mister Jones?										 "
"			I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more"
"No, I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more"
"Well, I wake in the morning"
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin me insane
Its a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more
I aint gonna work for Maggies brother no more
"No, I aint gonna work for Maggies brother no more"
"Well, he hands you a nickel"
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If youre havin a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I aint gonna work for Maggies brother no more
I aint gonna work for Maggies pa no more
"No, I aint gonna work for Maggies pa no more"
"Well, he puts his cigar"
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
"Ah, I aint gonna work for Maggies pa no more"
I aint gonna work for Maggies ma no more
"No, I aint gonna work for Maggies ma no more"
"Well, she talks to all the servants"
About man and God and law
Everybody says
Shes the brains behind pa
"Shes sixty-eight, but she says shes twenty-four"
I aint gonna work for Maggies ma no more
I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more
"No, I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more"

Theyll stone ya just a-like they said they would
Theyll stone ya when youre tryin to go home
Then theyll stone ya when youre there all alone
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Theyll stone ya when youre tryin to keep your seat
Theyll stone ya when youre walkin on the floor
Theyll stone ya when youre walkin to the door
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Theyll stone ya when youre at the breakfast table
Theyll stone ya when you are young and able
Theyll stone ya when youre tryin to make a buck
"Theyll stone ya and then theyll say, good luck"
"Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone"
Everybody must get stoned
"Well, theyll stone you and say that its the end"
Then theyll stone you and then theyll come back again
Theyll stone you when youre riding in your car
Theyll stone you when youre playing your guitar
"Yes, but I would not feel so all alone"
Everybody must get stoned
"Well, theyll stone you when you walk all alone"
Theyll stone you when you are walking home
Theyll stone you and then say you are brave
Theyll stone you when you are set down in your grave
But I would not feel so all alone
"Everybody must get stoned										 "
"			It aint no use to sit and wonder why, babe"
"It dont matter, anyhow"
"An it aint no use to sit and wonder why, babe"

Look out your window and Ill be gone
Youre the reason Im travlin on
"Dont think twice, its all right"
"It aint no use in turnin on your light, babe"
That light I never knowed
"An it aint no use in turnin on your light, babe"
Im on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin anyway
"So dont think twice, its all right"
"It aint no use in callin out my name, gal"
Like you never did before
"It aint no use in callin out my name, gal"
I cant hear you anymore
Im a-thinkin and a-wondrin all the way down the road
"I once loved a woman, a child Im told"
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
"But dont think twice, its all right"
"Im walkin down that long, lonesome road, babe"
"Where Im bound, I cant tell"
"But goodbyes too good a word, gal"
So Ill just say fare thee well
I aint sayin you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I dont mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
"But dont think twice, its all right										 "
"			Go way from my window"
Leave at your own chosen speed
"Im not the one you want, babe"
Im not the one you need
You say youre lookin for someone
Never weak but always strong
To protect you an defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
"But it aint me, babe"
"No, no, no, it aint me, babe"
"It aint me youre lookin for, babe"
"Go lightly from the ledge, babe"
Go lightly on the ground
"Im not the one you want, babe"
I will only let you down
You say youre lookin for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you an more
"But it aint me, babe"
"No, no, no, it aint me, babe"
"It aint me youre lookin for, babe"
"Go melt back into the night, babe"
Everything inside is made of stone
Theres nothing in here moving
An anyway Im not alone
You say youre lookin' for someone
Wholl pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
An to come each time you call
A lover for your life an nothing more
"But it aint me, babe"
"No, no, no, it aint me, babe"
"It aint me youre lookin for, babe										 "
"			Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
Im not sleepy and there is no place Im going to
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
In the jingle jangle morning Ill come followin you
Though I know that evenins empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
"My weariness amazes me, Im branded on my feet"
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
Im not sleepy and there is no place Im going to
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
In the jingle jangle morning Ill come followin you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin ship
"My senses have been stripped, my hands cant feel to grip"
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin
"Im ready to go anywhere, Im ready for to fade"
"Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way"
I promise to go under it
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
Im not sleepy and there is no place Im going to
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
In the jingle jangle morning Ill come followin you
"Though you might hear laughin, spinnin, swingin madly across the sun"
"Its not aimed at anyone, its just escapin on the run"
And but for the sky there are no fences facin
And if you hear vague traces of skippin reels of rhyme
"To your tambourine in time, its just a ragged clown behind"
I wouldnt pay it any mind
Its just a shadow youre seein that hes chasing
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
Im not sleepy and there is no place Im going to
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
In the jingle jangle morning Ill come followin you
Then take me disappearin through the smoke rings of my mind
"Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves"
"The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach"
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
"Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free"
"Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands"
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
Im not sleepy and there is no place Im going to
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me"
"In the jingle jangle morning Ill come followin you										 "
"			Come you masters of war"
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like its your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
Youve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You aint worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that Im young
You might say Im unlearned
But theres one thing I know
Though Im younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your deathll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And Ill watch while youre lowered
Down to your deathbed
And Ill stand oer your grave
"Til Im sure that youre dead										 "
"			Nobody feels any pain"
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Evrybody knows
That Babys got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
"She takes just like a woman, yes, she does"
"She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does"
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
"Queen Mary, shes my friend"
"Yes, I believe Ill go see her again"
Nobody has to guess
That Baby cant be blessed
Till she sees finally that shes like all the rest
"With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls"
"She takes just like a woman, yes, she does"
"She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does"
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But whats worse
Is this pain in here
I cant stay in here
Aint it clear that
I just cant fit
"Yes, I believe its time for us to quit"
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please dont let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
"Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do"
"You make love just like a woman, yes, you do"
Then you ache just like a woman
"But you break just like a little girl										 "
"			Summer days, summer nights are gone"
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where theres still somethin going on
"I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud"
"I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out lying in the mud"
"Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood"
Everybody get readylift your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift your glasses and sing
"Well, Im standin on the table, Im proposing a toast to the King"
Well Im drivin in the flats in a Cadillac car
"The girls all say, Youre a worn-out star"
My pockets are loaded and Im spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know its me all the time?
"Well, the fogs so thick you cant spy the land"
The fog is so thick that you cant even spy the land
"What good are you anyway, if you cant stand up to some old businessman?"
"Wedding bells ringin, the choir is beginning to sing"
"Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir is beginning to sing"
"What looks good in the day, at night is another thing"
"Shes looking into my eyes, shes holding my hand"
"Shes looking into my eyes, shes holding my hand"
"She says, You cant repeat the past. I say, You cant? What do you mean,"
you cant? Of course you can.
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry thats nothin you would need to know
"Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like its stuck"
Why dont you break my heart one more time just for good luck
"I got eight carburetors, boys Im using em all"
"Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, Im using em all"
"Im short on gas, my motors starting to stall"
"My dogs are barking, there must be someone around"
"My dogs are barking, there must be someone around"
"I got my hammer ringin, pretty baby, but the nails aint goin down"
"You got something to say, speak or hold your peace"
"Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace"
If its information you want you can go get it from the police
Politician got on his jogging shoes
"He must be running for office, got no time to lose"
He been suckin the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyesyou been teasing me
"Standing by Gods river, my soul is beginnin to shake"
"Standing by Gods river, my soul is beginnin to shake"
"Im countin on you love, to give me a break"
"Well, Im leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift"
"Yes, Im leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift"
Gonna break the roof inset fire to the place as a parting gift
"Summer days, summer nights are gone"
"Summer days, summer nights are gone"
"I know a place where theres still somethin going on										 "
"			A worried man with a worried mind"
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne
"Got white skin, got assassins eyes"
Im looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
"Im well dressed, waiting on the last train"
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now Im expecting all hell to break loose
People are crazy and times are strange
"Im locked in tight, Im out of range"
"I used to care, but things have changed"
This place aint doing me any good
"Im in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood"
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
"Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag"
"Aint no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag"
Only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove
"Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too"
"Dont get up gentlemen, Im only passing through"
People are crazy and times are strange
"Im locked in tight, Im out of range"
"I used to care, but things have changed"
Ive been walking forty miles of bad road
"If the Bible is right, the world will explode"
Ive been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You cant win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
People are crazy and times are strange
"Im locked in tight, Im out of range"
"I used to care, but things have changed"
"I hurt easy, I just dont show it"
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
"Gonna get low down, gonna fly high"
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me
"Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake"
Im not that eager to make a mistake
People are crazy and times are strange
"Im locked in tight, Im out of range"
"I used to care, but things have changed										 "
"			Darkness at the break of noon"
Shadows even the silver spoon
"The handmade blade, the childs balloon"
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying
"Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn"
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
"Plays wasted words, proves to warn"
That he not busy being born is busy dying
Temptations page flies out the door
"You follow, find yourself at war"
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that youd just be one more
Person crying
So dont fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
"Its alright, Ma, Im only sighing"
"As some warn victory, some downfall"
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say dont hate nothing at all
Except hatred
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
Its easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked
An though the rules of the road have been lodged
Its only peoples games that you got to dodge
"And its alright, Ma, I can make it"
Advertising signs they con
You into thinking youre the one
That can do whats never been done
That can win whats never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you
"You lose yourself, you reappear"
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
"When a trembling distant voice, unclear"
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
"To satisfy, insure you not to quit"
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
"I got nothing, Ma, to live up to"
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
"Who despise their jobs, their destinies"
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something they invest in
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from societys pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That hes in
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
"But its alright, Ma, if I cant please him"
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
"Limited in sex, they dare"
"To push fake morals, insult and stare"
"While money doesnt talk, it swears"
"Obscenity, who really cares"
"Propaganda, all is phony"
While them that defend what they cannot see
"With a killers pride, security"
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think deaths honesty
Wont fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
"Graveyards, false gods, I scuff"
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
"Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?"
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
Theyd probably put my head in a guillotine
"But its alright, Ma, its life, and life only										 "
"			Im walking through streets that are dead"
"Walking, walking with you in my head"
"My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired"
And the clouds are weeping
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someones distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping
Im sick of love but Im in the thick of it
This kind of love Im so sick of it
"I see, I see lovers in the meadow"
"I see, I see silhouettes in the window"
I watch them til theyre gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow
Im sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; Im love sick
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I feel like Im being plowed under
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder
Im sick of love; I wish Id never met you
Im sick of love; Im trying to forget you
Just dont know what to do
"Id give anything to be with you										 "
"			Oh, the ragman draws circles"
Up and down the block
Id ask him what the matter was
But I know that he dont talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I cant escape
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
"Well, Shakespeare, hes in the alley"
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if shes talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
"An I said, Oh, I didnt know that"
"But then again, theres only one Ive met"
An he just smoked my eyelids
An punched my cigarette
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Grandpa died last week
And now hes buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
"But me, I expected it to happen"
I knew hed lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the senator came down here
Showing evryone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
"An me, I nearly got busted"
An wouldnt it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
"Then I whispered, Not even you can hide"
"You see, youre just like me"
I hope youre satisfied
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the rainman gave me two cures
"Then he said, Jump right in"
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
An like a fool I mixed them
An it strangled up my mind
An now people just get uglier
An I have no sense of time
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
Neath her Panamanian moon
"An I say, Aw come on now"
You must know about my debutante
"An she says, Your debutante just knows what you need"
But I know what you want
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
An here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
"Oh, Mama, can this really be the end"
To be stuck inside of Mobile
"With the Memphis blues again										 "
"			High water risinrisin night and day"
All the gold and silver are bein' stolen away
Big Joe Turner lookin east and west
From the dark room of his mind
He made it to Kansas City
Twelfth Street and Vine
Nothin' standing there
High water everywhere
"High water risin, the shacks are slidin down"
Folks lose their possessionsfolks are leaving town
Bertha Mason shook itbroke it
Then she hung it on a wall
"Says, Youre dancin with whom they tell you to"
Or you dont dance at all
Its tough out there
High water everywhere
I got a cravin love for blazing speed
Got a hopped-up Mustang Ford
"Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties on the board"
"I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind"
Im no pig without a wig
I hope you treat me kind
Things are breakin up out there
High water everywhere
"High water risin, six inches bove my head"
Coffins droppin in the street
Like balloons made out of lead
"Water pourin into Vicksburg, dont know what Im goin' to do"
"Dont reach out for me, she said"
Cant you see Im drownin too?
Its rough out there
High water everywhere
"Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian and the Jew"
"You cant open your mind, boys"
To every conceivable point of view
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
"Judge says to the High Sheriff,"
I want him dead or alive
"Either one, I dont care"
High water everywhere
"The Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies"
Im preachin the Word of God
Im puttin out your eyes
"I asked Fat Nancy for somethin' to eat, she said, Take it off the shelf"
As great as you are a man
Youll never be greater than yourself
I told her I didnt really care
High water everywhere
Im gettin up in the morningI believe Ill dust my broom
Keeping away from the women
Im givin em lots of room
"Thunder rolling over Clarkesdale, everything is looking blue"
"I just cant be happy, love"
Unless youre happy too
Its bad out there
"High water everywhere										 "
"			They sat together in the park"
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
Twas then he felt alone and wished that hed gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
They walked along by the old canal
"A little confused, I remember well"
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate
A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin by the arcade
"As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin up,"
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
"He woke up, the room was bare"
He didnt see her anywhere
"He told himself he didnt care, pushed the window open wide"
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
"Maybe shell pick him out again, how long must he wait"
Once more for a simple twist of fate
People tell me its a sin
To know and feel too much within
"I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring"
"She was born in spring, but I was born too late"
"Blame it on a simple twist of fate										 "
"			Come gather round people"
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
Youll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin
Then you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance wont come again
And dont speak too soon
For the wheels still in spin
And theres no tellin who that its namin
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin
"Come senators, congressmen"
Please heed the call
Dont stand in the doorway
Dont block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
Theres a battle outside and it is ragin
Itll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And dont criticize
What you cant understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin
Please get out of the new one if you cant lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin
And the first one now will later be last
"For the times they are a-changin										 "
"			Well, Im stranded in the city that never sleeps"
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
Im avoidin the Southside the best I can
"These memories I got, they can strangle a man"
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Lot of things can get in the way when youre tryin to do whats right
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
Youd be honest with me if only you knew
Im not sorry for nothin Ive done
Im glad I foughtI only wish wed won
The Siamese twins are comin to town
People cant waittheyre gathered around
When I left my home the sky split open wide
I never wanted to go back thereId rather have died
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
Youd be honest with me if only you knew
My woman got a face like a teddy bear
Shes tossin a baseball bat in the air
The meat is so tough you cant cut it with a sword
"Im crashin my car, trunk first into the boards"
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
"Well, Ill sell it to ya at a reduced price"
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
"Youd be honest with me, if only you knew"
Some things are too terrible to be true
I wont come here no more if it bothers you
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
Im having a hard time believin some people were ever alive
"Im stark naked, but I dont care"
"Im going off into the woods, Im huntin bare"
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
"Well, youd be honest with me if only you knew"
Im here to create the new imperial empire
Im going to do whatever circumstances require
I care so much for youdidnt think that I could
I cant tell my heart that youre no good
"Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years"
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
"Well, youd be honest with me if only you knew										 "
"			Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon"
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
"Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow"
"Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go "
"I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying"
"When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line"
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee 
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
"You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away"
"The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say "
"Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum"
"Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from"
"I don't need any guide, I already know the way"
"Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day "
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
"Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need "
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 
"Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches"
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 
"I got the porkchops, she got the pie"
She ain't no angel and neither am I
"Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes"
"I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams "
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
"Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down "
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed  no need to confess again 
"Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north"
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
"The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf"
"For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself										 "
"			Stake my future on a hell of a past"
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
"Seen better times, but who has not?"
Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train
I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door
"I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain"
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain
One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong
Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
"Find out something only dead men know										 "
"			You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last"
"But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast"
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin through
"And its all over now, Baby Blue"
"The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense"
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
"This sky, too, is folding under you"
"And its all over now, Baby Blue"
"All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home"
"All your reindeer armies, are all going home"
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
"The carpet, too, is moving under you"
"And its all over now, Baby Blue"
"Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you"
"Forget the dead youve left, they will not follow you"
The vagabond whos rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
"Strike another match, go start anew"
"And its all over now, Baby Blue										 "
"			Well, if youre travelin in the north country fair"
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
"Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm"
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if shes wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin winds
"Please see for me if her hair hangs long,"
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
"Please see for me if her hair hangs long,"
Thats the way I remember her best.
Im a-wonderin if she remembers me at all
Many times Ive often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So if youre travelin in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
"She once was a true love of mine										 "
"			Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat"
"Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat"
"Well, you must tell me, baby"
How your head feels under somethin like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
"Well, you look so pretty in it"
"Honey, can I jump on it sometime?"
"Yes, I just wanna see"
If its really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
"Well, if you wanna see the sun rise"
"Honey, I know where"
Well go out and see it sometime
Well both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt
Wrapped around my head
And you just sittin there
In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
"Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you"
"Its bad for your health, he said"
"Yes, I disobeyed his orders"
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
"You know, I dont mind him cheatin on me"
But I sure wish hed take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
"Well, I see you got a new boyfriend"
"You know, I never seen him before"
"Well, I saw him"
Makin love to you
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
"Its your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat										 "
"			Spirit on the water "
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby 
I can't hardly sleep 
I'm traveling by land 
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind 
I can't stay away 
I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends 
When you are near 
It's just as plain as it can be
"I'm wild about you, gal "
You ought to be a fool about me 
Can't explain 
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart 
You got the key to my brain 
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love 
Life without you 
Doesn't mean a thing to me
"If I can't have you,"
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
Sometimes I wonder 
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day 
Then you do wrong all night 
When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter 
What price I pay 
They brag about your sugar 
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them
I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me
I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind
Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can
I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back til fall
High on the hill 
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two
I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there
You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
"We can have a whoppin' good time										 "
"			Whats the matter with me"
I dont have much to say
Daylight sneakin through the window
And Im still in this all-night café
Walkin to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rollin slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow
Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now Ill just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow
"People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah"
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldnt help but cry
"Oh, this ol river keeps on rollin, though"
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does Ill just sit here
And watch the river flow
People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you wanna stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook
"But this ol river keeps on rollin, though"
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does Ill just sit here
And watch the river flow
Watch the river flow
Watchin the river flow
Watchin the river flow
But Ill sit down on this bank of sand
"And watch the river flow										 "
"			May God bless and keep you always"
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
"Forever young, forever young"
May you stay forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
"Forever young, forever young"
May you stay forever young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
"Forever young, forever young"
"May you stay forever young										 "
"			Shes got everything she needs"
"Shes an artist, she dont look back"
Shes got everything she needs
"Shes an artist, she dont look back"
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees
She never stumbles
Shes got no place to fall
She never stumbles
Shes got no place to fall
Shes nobodys child
The Law cant touch her at all
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
Shes a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween give her a trumpet
"And for Christmas, buy her a drum										 "
"			They say evrything can be replaced"
Yet evry distance is not near
So I remember evry face
Of evry man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
"Any day now, any day now"
I shall be released
They say evry man needs protection
They say evry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
"Any day now, any day now"
I shall be released
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears hes not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
"Any day now, any day now"
"I shall be released										 "
"			Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee"
Theyre throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead mans bones
Got their noses to the grindstones
Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
"Well, theyre going to the country, theyre gonna retire"
Theyre taking a street car named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things theyd like they would never buy
Neither one gonna turn and run
Theyre making a voyage to the sun
His Masters voice is calling me
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
Your presence is obnoxious to me
Theyre like babies sittin on a womans knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
"Well, the rain beating down on my window pane"
I got love for you and its all in vain
"Brains in the pot, theyre beginning to boil"
Theyre dripping with garlic and olive oil
Tweedle-dee Deehes on his hands and his knees
"Saying, Throw me somethin, Mister, please"
Whats good for you is good for me
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
"Well, theyre living in a happy harmony"
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Theyre one day older and a dollar short
Theyve got a parade permit and a police escort
Theyre lying low and theyre makin hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
"My pretty baby, shes lookin around"
Shes wearin a multi-thousand dollar gown
"Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man"
"Tweedle-dee Dum, hell stab you where you stand"
"Ive had too much of your company,"
"Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee										 "
"			Theyre selling postcards of the hanging"
Theyre painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
Theyve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad theyre restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
"Cinderella, she seems so easy"
"It takes one to know one, she smiles"
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
"And in comes Romeo, hes moaning"
You Belong to Me I Believe
"And someone says, Youre in the wrong place my friend"
You better leave
And the only sound thats left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
"And the Good Samaritan, hes dressing"
Hes getting ready for the show
Hes going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
"Now Ophelia, shes neath the window"
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
"To her, death is quite romantic"
She wears an iron vest
Her professions her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noahs great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
"Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood"
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
"With his friend, a jealous monk"
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
"Dr. Filth, he keeps his world"
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
Theyre trying to blow it up
"Now his nurse, some local loser"
Shes in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
Have Mercy on His Soul
They all play on pennywhistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street theyve nailed the curtains
Theyre getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
Theyre spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then theyll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantoms shouting to skinny girls
Get Outa Here If You Dont Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Neros Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybodys shouting
Which Side Are You On?
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captains tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
"Yes, I received your letter yesterday"
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
"Yes, I know them, theyre quite lame"
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I cant read too good
"Dont send me no more letters, no"
Not unless you mail them
"From Desolation Row										 "
"			Mama, take this badge off of me"
I cant use it anymore
"Its gettin dark, too dark for me to see"
I feel like Im knockin on heavens door
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Mama, put my guns in the ground"
I cant shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin down
I feel like Im knockin on heavens door
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door"
"Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door										 "
"			Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?"
"Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?"
Ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
"And its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, and its a hard"
And its a hard rains a-gonna fall
"Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?"
"Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?"
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
"And its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, its a hard"
And its a hard rains a-gonna fall
"And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?"
"And what did you hear, my darling young one?"
"I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin"
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin
Heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin
"Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin"
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
"And its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, its a hard"
And its a hard rains a-gonna fall
"Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?"
"Who did you meet, my darling young one?"
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
"I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow"
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
"And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard"
Its a hard rains a-gonna fall
"Oh, whatll you do now, my blue-eyed son?"
"Oh, whatll you do now, my darling young one?"
Im a-goin back out fore the rain starts a-fallin
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioners face is always well hidden
"Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten"
"Where black is the color, where none is the number"
And Ill tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinkin
But Ill know my song well before I start singin
"And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard"
"Its a hard rains a-gonna fall										 "
"			Close your eyes, close the door"
You dont have to worry anymore
Ill be your baby tonight
"Shut the light, shut the shade"
You dont have to be afraid
Ill be your baby tonight
"Well, that mockingbirds gonna sail away"
Were gonna forget it
"That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon"
But were gonna let it
You wont regret it
"Kick your shoes off, do not fear"
Bring that bottle over here
"Ill be your baby tonight										 "
"			Im beginning to hear voices and theres no one around"
"Well, Im all used up and the fields have turned brown"
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
"Im waist deep, waist deep in the mist"
"Its almost like, almost like I dont exist"
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
The walls of pride are high and wide
Cant see over to the other side
Its such a sad thing to see beauty decay
Its sadder still to feel your heart torn away
One look at you and Im out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
"Theres too many people, too many to recall"
"I thought some of m were friends of mine, I was wrong about m all"
"Well, the road is rocky and the hillsides mud"
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
"I found my world, found my world in you"
But your love just hasnt proved true
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
"Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds"
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill
Its you and you only I been thinking about
But you cant see in and its hard lookin out
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Well the fats in the fire and the waters in the tank
The whiskeys in the jar and the moneys in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
Im gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
Looking at you and Im on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
"Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound										 "

And youre the best thing that hes ever seen
"Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile"
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When hes standing in front of you
"Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed"
"Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead"
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
"Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead										 "
"			I love you pretty baby "
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' we can call our own
I'm movin' after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what to do without it
Without this love that we call ours
Beyond here lies nothin'
Nothin' but the moon and stars
Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothin'
But the mountains of the past
My ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
Beyond here lies nothin'
"Nothin' done and nothin' said										 "
"			Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood"
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
"I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form"
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured"
"Ill always do my best for her, on that I give my word"
"In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm"
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved"
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where its always safe and warm
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail"
Poisoned in the bushes an blown out on the trail
"Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn"
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"Now theres a wall between us, somethin theres been lost"
"I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed"
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount"
"But nothing really matters much, its doom alone that counts"
"And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn"
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
Ive heard newborn babies wailin like a mournin dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
"Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?"
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes"
I bargained for salvation an they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm"
"Well, Im livin in a foreign country but Im bound to cross the line"
"Beauty walks a razors edge, someday Ill make it mine"
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
"Come in, she said, Ill give you shelter from the storm										 "
"			Ramona"
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise
The flowers of the city
Though breathlike
Get deathlike at times
And theres no use in tryin
T deal with the dyin
Though I cannot explain that in lines
Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be under the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes Im in
"But it grieves my heart, love"
To see you tryin to be a part of
A world that just dont exist
"Its all just a dream, babe"
"A vacuum, a scheme, babe"
That sucks you into feelin like this
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin and returnin
On back to the South
Youve been fooled into thinking
That the finishin end is at hand
Yet theres no one to beat you
No one t defeat you
Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
Ive heard you say many times
That youre better n no one
And no one is better n you
If you really believe that
You know you got
Nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you must be exactly like them
Id forever talk to you
But soon my words
They would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
"Who knows, baby"
"Ill come and be cryin to you										 "
"			My love she speaks like silence"
Without ideals or violence
She doesnt have to say shes faithful
"Yet shes true, like ice, like fire"
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines cant buy her
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
"Read books, repeat quotations"
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows theres no success like failure
And that failures no success at all
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
"My love winks, she does not bother"
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love shes like some raven
"At my window with a broken wing										 "
"			You got a lotta nerve"
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side thats winning
You say I let you down
You know its not like that
If youre so hurt
Why then dont you show it
You say you lost your faith
But thats not where its at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
Youre in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think Id make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he dont know to begin with
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
"You say, How are you? Good luck"
But you dont mean it
When you know as well as me
Youd rather see me paralyzed
Why dont you just come out once
And scream it
"No, I do not feel that good"
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps Id rob them
And now I know youre dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Dont you understand
Its not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you
"Yes, I wish that for just one time"
You could stand inside my shoes
Youd know what a drag it is
"To see you										 "
"			I cant understand"
She let go of my hand
An left me here facing the wall
Id sure like t know
Why she did go
But I cant get close t her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now mornins clear
Its like I aint here
She just acts like we never have met
Its all new t me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
Yet its hard t think on
That shes the same one
That last night I was with
"From darkness, dreamsre deserted"
Am I still dreamin yet?
I wish shed unlock
Her voice once an talk
Stead of acting like we never have met
If she aint feelin well
Then why dont she tell
Stead of turnin her back t my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me t return t her chase
Though the night ran swirling an whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she dont
An evidently she wont
She just acts like we never have met
If I didnt have t guess
Id gladly confess
T anything I mightve tried
If I was with er too long
Or have done something wrong
"I wish shed tell me what it is, Ill run an hide"
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she aint the same
She just acts like we never have met
Im leavin today
Ill be on my way
Of this I cant say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
An pretend that we never have touched
An if anybody asks me
Is it easy to forget?
"Ill say, Its easily done"
You just pick anyone
"An pretend that you never have met!										 "

"			You say you love me"
And youre thinkin of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanna hold me
But you know youre not that strong
I just cant do what I done before
I just cant beg you anymore
Im gonna let you pass
And Ill go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And whos been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
You say you disturb me
And you dont deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say youre shakin
And youre always achin
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It cant be this way evrywhere
And Im gonna let you pass
"Yes, and Ill go last"
Then time will tell just who fell
And whos been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
"The judge, he holds a grudge"
Hes gonna call on you
But hes badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he dont fall on you
You say youre sorry
For tellin stories
That you know I believe are true
You say ya got some
Other kinda lover
"And yes, I believe you do"
You say my kisses are not like his
But this time Im not gonna tell you why that is
Im just gonna let you pass
"Yes, and Ill go last"
Then time will tell who fell
And whos been left behind
"When you go your way and I go mine										  "
"			The cats in the well, the wolf is looking down"
"The cats in the well, the wolf is looking down"
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground
"The cats in the well, the gentle lady is asleep"
"Cats in the well, the gentle lady is asleep"
"She aint hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin her deep"
The cats in the well and grief is showing its face
The worlds being slaughtered and its such a bloody disgrace
"The cats in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump"
"The cats in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump"
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
"The cats in the well, and Papa is reading the news"
His hairs falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
The cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
"The night is so long and the table is oh, so full"
The cats in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war

"The cats in the well, leaves are starting to fall"

"			Oh, Im sailin away my own true love"
Im sailin away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that Ill be landing?
"No, theres nothin you can send me, my own true love"
Theres nothin I wish to be ownin
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
"Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine"
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
"Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night"
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
Id forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For thats all Im wishin to be ownin
That I might be gone a long time
And its only that Im askin
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin
"Oh, how can, how can you ask me again"
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin
Saying I dont know when Ill be comin back again
It depends on how Im a-feelin
"Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way"
Im sure your mind is roamin
Im sure your heart is not with me
But with the country to where youre goin
"So take heed, take heed of the western wind"
Take heed of the stormy weather
"And yes, theres something you can send back to me"
"Spanish boots of Spanish leather										 "
"			William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll"
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gathrin
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now aint the time for your tears
"William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years"
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
"And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling"
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now aint the time for your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didnt even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
"Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane"
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now aint the time for your tears
"In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel"
To show that alls equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books aint pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin that way without warnin
"And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished"
"And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance"
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
"Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears"
Bury the rag deep in your face
"For nows the time for your tears										 "
"			Crickets are chirpin, the water is high"
Theres a soft cotton dress on the line hangin dry
"Window wide open, African trees"
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
"Not a word of goodbye, not even a note"
She gone with the man
In the long black coat
Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
"If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask"
Somebody said from the Bible hed quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat
"Preacher was a talkin, theres a sermon he gave"
He said every mans conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When its you who must keep it satisfied
"It aint easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat"
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
"But people don't live or die, people just float"
She went with the man
In the long black coat
"Theres smoke on the water, its been there since June"
"Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon"
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
"She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote"
She gone with the man
"In the long black coat										 "
"			Broken lines, broken strings"
"Broken threads, broken springs"
"Broken idols, broken heads"
People sleeping in broken beds
Aint no use jiving
Aint no use joking
Everything is broken
"Broken bottles, broken plates"
"Broken switches, broken gates"
"Broken dishes, broken parts"
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground
"Broken cutters, broken saws"
"Broken buckles, broken laws"
"Broken bodies, broken bones"
Broken voices on broken phones
"Take a deep breath, feel like youre chokin'"
Everything is broken
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face
Broken hands on broken ploughs
"Broken treaties, broken vows"
"Broken pipes, broken tools"
People bending broken rules
"Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking"
"Everything is broken										   "
"			There's an evenin' haze settlin' over the town"
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad 
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listenin' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut 
"Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind"
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
"Now, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul"
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag em all down to hell and I'll stand em at the wall
I'll sell em to their enemies
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away 
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
"No man, no woman knows "
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death
"Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind"
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
"Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse"
I can't save a dime
"I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced"
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see 
"Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking"
That you have forgotten me? 
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
"It's all true, everything you have heard "
"Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind"
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
"In you, my friend, I find no blame"
"Wanna look in my eyes, please do"
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so 
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means 
"Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind"
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
"Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues										 "
"			Señor, señor, do you know where were headin?"
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Seems like I been down this way before
"Is there any truth in that, señor?"
"Señor, señor, do you know where she is hidin?"
How long are we gonna be ridin?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
"Will there be any comfort there, señor?"
Theres a wicked wind still blowin on that upper deck
Theres an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck
Theres a marchin band still playin in that vacant lot
"Where she held me in her arms one time and said, Forget me not"
"Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon"
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Cant stand the suspense anymore
"Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?"
"Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled"
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
"Said, Son, this aint a dream no more, its the real thing"
"Señor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather"
"Well, give me a minute, let me get it together"
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
"Im ready when you are, señor"
"Señor, señor, lets disconnect these cables"
Overturn these tables
This place dont make sense to me no more
"Can you tell me what were waiting for, señor?										 "
"			Crimson flames tied through my ears"
Rollin high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"Well meet on edges, soon, said I"
Proud neath heated brow
"Ah, but I was so much older then"
Im younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate, I screamed"
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
"Foundationed deep, somehow"
"Ah, but I was so much older then"
Im younger than that now
Girls faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
"Unthought of, though, somehow"
"Ah, but I was so much older then"
Im younger than that now
A self-ordained professors tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
"Equality, I spoke the word"
As if a wedding vow
"Ah, but I was so much older then"
Im younger than that now
"In a soldiers stance, I aimed my hand"
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that Id become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
"Ah, but I was so much older then"
Im younger than that now
"Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats"
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
"Good and bad, I define these terms"
"Quite clear, no doubt, somehow"
"Ah, but I was so much older then"
"Im younger than that now										 "
"			They ask me how I feel"
And if my love is real
And how I know Ill make it through
"And they, they look at me and frown"
Theyd like to drive me from this town
They dont want me around
Cause I believe in you
They show me to the door
They say dont come back no more
Cause I dont be like theyd like me to
And I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I dont feel alone
Cause I believe in you
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
I believe in you even though we be apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
"Oh, when the dawn is nearing"
"Oh, when the night is disappearing"
"Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart"
Dont let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which youve given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you
I believe in you when winter turn to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
"Oh, though the earth may shake me"
"Oh, though my friends forsake me"
"Oh, even that couldnt make me go back"
Dont let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
"And I, I dont mind the pain"
Dont mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
"Cause I believe in you										 "
"			Oh, help me in my weakness"
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
My trip hasnt been a pleasant one
And my time it isnt long
And I still do not know
What it was that Ive done wrong
"Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside"
A tear came to his eye
"You fail to understand, he said"
Why must you even try?
"Outside, the crowd was stirring"
You could hear it from the door
"Inside, the judge was stepping down"
While the jury cried for more
"Oh, stop that cursed jury"
Cried the attendant and the nurse
The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while evrybody knelt to pray
"The drifter did escape										   "
"			When youre lost in the rain in Juarez"
And its Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity dont pull you through
Dont put on any airs
When youre down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I dont have the strength
To get up and take another shot
"And my best friend, my doctor"
Wont even say what it is Ive got
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And youre so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
Its either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If youre lookin to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops dont need you
And man they expect the same
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost
I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said theyd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
Im going back to New York City
"I do believe Ive had enough										 "
"			Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down"
But it looks like it dont
Id like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you wont
From now on Ill be busy
Aint goin nowhere fast
Im just glad its over
And Im seeing the real you at last
"Well, didnt I risk my neck for you"
Didnt I take chances?
Didnt I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?
"Well, I have had some rotten nights"
Didnt think that they would pass
Im just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last
Im hungry and Im irritable
And Im tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix
"Well, I sailed through the storm"
Strapped to the mast
But the time has come
And Im seeing the real you at last
"When I met you, baby"
You didnt show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Starr
"Well, I dont mind a reasonable amount of trouble"
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that Im seeing the real you at last
"Well, Im gonna quit this baby talk now"
I guess I should have known
"I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles"
I think maybe wed better leave each other alone
Whatever you gonna do
Please do it fast
Im still trying to get used to
"Seeing the real you at last										 "
"			What good am I if Im like all the rest"
"If I just turn away, when I see how youre dressed"
If I shut myself off so I cant hear you cry
What good am I?
What good am I if I know and dont do
"If I see and dont say, if I look right through you"
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin sky
What good am I?
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try
What good am I?
What good am I then to others and me
If Ive had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
"What good am I?										 "
"			Down the street the dogs are barkin"
And the day is a-gettin dark
As the night comes in a-fallin
The dogsll lose their bark
An the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For Im one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
An I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And Im one too many mornings
An a thousand miles behind
Its a restless hungry feeling
That dont mean no one no good
When evrything Im a-sayin
You can say it just as good.
Youre right from your side
Im right from mine
Were both just one too many mornings
"An a thousand miles behind										 "
"			Forgetful heart"
Lost your power of recall 
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better then you
Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer
Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before
Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore 
"If indeed there ever was a door										  "
"			Ill remember you"
When Ive forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When Im all alone
In the great unknown
Ill remember you
Ill remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
Theres some people that
You dont forget
Even though youve only seen m one time or two
When the roses fade
And Im in the shade
Ill remember you
"Didnt I, didnt I try to love you?"
"Didnt I, didnt I try to care?"
"Didnt I sleep, didnt I weep beside you"
With the rain blowing in your hair?
Ill remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though Id never say
That I done it the way
That youd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
"Ill remember you										 "
"			Seen the arrow on the doorpost"
"Saying, This land is condemned"
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
"Well, I heard that hoot owl singing"
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Hear that undertakers bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Theres a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
Hes dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
Theres a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
"Well, God is in His heaven"
And we all want whats his
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
Im gazing out the window
Of the St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
"Like Blind Willie McTell										 "
"			Of war and peace the truth just twists"
Its curfew gull just glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when neath the trees of Eden
The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter whos gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden
Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
The motorcycle black madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
The kingdoms of Experience
In the precious wind they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss whats real and what is not
It doesnt matter inside the Gates of Eden
"The foreign sun, it squints upon"
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
"Leaving men wholly, totally free"
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell whats true
"And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden										 "
"			Aint it just like the night to play tricks when youre tryin' to be so quiet?"
"We sit here stranded, though were all doin our best to deny it"
"And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin you to defy it"
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
"But theres nothing, really nothing to turn off"
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindmans bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if its him or them thats really insane
"Louise, shes all right, shes just near"
Shes delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johannas not here
The ghost of lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
"Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously"
"He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously"
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
Hes sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while Im in the hall
How can I explain?
"Oh, its so hard to get on"
"And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn"
"Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial"
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
"Hear the one with the mustache say, Jeeze"
I cant find my knees
"Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule"
"But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel"
The peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him
"Sayin, Name me someone thats not a parasite and Ill go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"Ya cant look at much, can ya man?"
"As she, herself, prepares for him"
"And Madonna, she still has not showed"
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
"The fiddler, he now steps to the road"
He writes evrythings been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
"And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain										 "
"			The guilty undertaker sighs"
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But its not that way
I wasnt born to lose you
"I want you, I want you"
I want you so bad
"Honey, I want you"
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
"And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you"
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you
"I want you, I want you"
I want you so bad
"Honey, I want you"
"How all my fathers, theyve gone down"
True love theyve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
Cause I dont think about it
"Well, I return to the Queen of Spades"
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that Im not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And theres nothing she doesnt see
She knows where Id like to be
But it doesnt matter
"I want you, I want you"
I want you so bad
"Honey, I want you"
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
"He spoke to me, I took his flute"
"No, I wasnt very cute to him, was I?"
"But I did it, though, because he lied"
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I . . .
"I want you, I want you"
I want you so bad
"Honey, I want you										 "
"			Our conversation was short and sweet"
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
"And Im back in the rain, oh, oh"
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
Youre a big girl now
"Bird on the horizon, sittin on a fence"
Hes singin his song for me at his own expense
"And Im just like that bird, oh, oh"
Singin just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singin through these tears
"Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast"
"Oh, but what a shame if all weve shared cant last"
"I can change, I swear, oh, oh"
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
"Love is so simple, to quote a phrase"
"Youve known it all the time, Im learnin it these days"
"Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh"
In somebodys room
Its a price I have to pay
Youre a big girl all the way
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But whats the sense of changing horses in midstream?
"Im going out of my mind, oh, oh"
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
"Ever since weve been apart										 "
"			Hollis Brown"
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin down
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they dont know how to smile
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre a-tuggin at your sleeve
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre a-tuggin at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If theres anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you aint a-got no friend
Your babies are crying louder
Its pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
Its pounding on your brain
Your wifes screams are stabbin you
Like the dirty drivin rain
Your grass it is turning black
Theres no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
Theres no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
Thats hangin on the wall
Your brain is a-bleedin
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That youre holdin in your hand
Theres seven breezes a-blowin
All around the cabin door
Theres seven breezes a-blowin
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the oceans pounding roar
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
"Theres seven new people born										 "
"			Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed"
"Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams"
"In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed"
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams
I and I
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
"One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives"
Think Ill go out and go for a walk
"Not much happenin here, nothin ever does"
"Besides, if she wakes up now, shell just want me to talk"
"I got nothin to say, specially about whatever was"
I and I
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
"One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives"
"Took an untrodden path once, where the swift dont win the race"
"It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth"
"Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justices beautiful face"
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I and I
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
"One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives"
Outside of two men on a train platform theres nobody in sight
"Theyre waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track"
"The world could come to an end tonight, but thats all right"
She should still be there sleepin when I get back
I and I
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
"One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives"
"Noontime, and Im still pushin myself along the road, the darkest part"
"Into the narrow lanes, I cant stumble or stay put"
"Someone else is speakin with my mouth, but Im listening only to my heart"
"Ive made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot"
I and I
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
"One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives										 "
"			Perhaps its the color of the sun cut flat"
An covrin the crossroads Im standing at
Or maybe its the weather or something like that
"But mama, you been on my mind"
"I dont mean trouble, please dont put me down or get upset"
"I am not pleadin or sayin, I cant forget"
"I do not walk the floor bowed down an bent, but yet"
"Mama, you been on my mind"
Even though my mind is hazy an my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been dont bother me nor bring me down in sorrow
It dont even matter to me where youre wakin up tomorrow
"But mama, youre just on my mind"
I am not askin you to say words like yes or no
"Please understand me, I got no place for you t go"
"Im just breathin to myself, pretendin not that I dont know"
"Mama, you been on my mind"
"When you wake up in the mornin, baby, look inside your mirror"
"You know I wont be next to you, you know I wont be near"
Id just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"As someone who has had you on his mind										 "
"			When the rain is blowing in your face"
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you havent made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
"Id go hungry, Id go black and blue"
Id go crawling down the avenue
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rollin sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You aint seen nothing like me yet
"I could make you happy, make your dreams come true"
Nothing that I wouldnt do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
"To make you feel my love										 "
"			Well, my nerves are exploding and my bodys tense"
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
"Ive been hit too hard, Ive seen too much"
"Nothing can heal me now, but your touch"
I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right til I fell in love with you
"Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky"
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like Im coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he wont lead me astray
Still I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right til I fell in love with you
Boys in the street beginning to play
Girls like birds flying away
When Im gone you will remember my name
Im gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right til I fell in love with you
"Junk is piling up, taking up space"
My eyes feel like theyre falling off my face
"Sweat falling down, Im staring at the floor"
Im thinking about that girl who wont be back no more
I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right til I fell in love with you
"Well, Im tired of talking, Im tired of trying to explain"
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
"If Im still among the living, Ill be Dixie bound"
I just dont know what Im gonna do
"I was all right til I fell in love with you										 "
"			God knows you aint pretty"
God knows its true
God knows there aint anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you
God knows its a struggle
God knows its a crime
God knows theres gonna be no more water
But fire next time
God dont call it treason
God dont call it wrong
It was supposed to last a season
But its been so strong for so long
God knows its fragile
God knows everything
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string
God knows its terrifying
God sees it all unfold
Theres a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold
God knows that when you see it
God knows youve got to weep
God knows the secrets of your heart
Hell tell them to you when youre asleep
God knows theres a river
God knows how to make it flow
God knows you aint gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go
God knows theres a purpose
God knows theres a chance
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance
God knows theres a heaven
God knows its out of sight
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
"Even if weve got to walk a million miles by candlelight										 "
"			I cant wait, wait for you to change your mind"
"Its late, Im trying to walk the line"
"Well, its way past midnight and there are people all around"
"Some on their way up, some on their way down"
The air burns and Im trying to think straight
And I dont know how much longer I can wait
"Im your man, Im trying to recover the sweet love that we knew"
You understand that my heart cant go on beating without you
"Well, your loveliness has wounded me, Im reeling from the blow"
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
"Im breathing hard, standing at the gate"
But I dont know how much longer I can wait
"Skies are grey, Im looking for anything that will bring a happy glow"
"Night or day, it doesnt matter where I go anymore, I just go"
If I ever saw you coming I dont know what I would do
"Id like to think I could control myself, but it isnt true"
Thats how it is when things disintegrate
And I dont know how much longer I can wait
"Im doomed to love you, Ive been rolling through stormy weather"
Im thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
"Its mighty funny, the end of time has just begun"
"Oh, honey, after all these years youre still the one"
While Im strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
"But I dont know how much longer I can wait										 "
"			In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need"
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
Theres a dyin voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
Dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake
"Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break"
In the fury of the moment I can see the Masters hand
"In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand"
"Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear"
"Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer"
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
"In the violence of a summers dream, in the chill of a wintry light"
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
"Sometimes I turn, theres someone there, other times its only me"
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
"Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand										 "
"			Well, your railroad gate, you know I just cant jump it"
"Sometimes it gets so hard, you see"
Im just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
"But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?"
"Well, I waited for you when I was half sick"
"Yes, I waited for you when you hated me"
"Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic"
When you knew I had some other place to be
"Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?"
"Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously"
"But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately"
"Well, six white horses that you did promise"
Were finlly delivered down to the penitentiary
"But to live outside the law, you must be honest"
I know you always say that you agree
"But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?"
"Well, I dont know how it happened"
"But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate"
"But evrybody else, even yourself"
Theyre just gonna have to wait
"Well, I got the fever down in my pockets"
"The Persian drunkard, he follows me"
"Yes, I can take him to your house but I cant unlock it"
"You see, you forgot to leave me with the key"
"Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?"
"Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed"
That a man cant give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
"Wondring where you are tonight, sweet Marie										 "
"			Crash on the levee, mama"
Water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise
No boat's gonna row
"Now, you can train on down"
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint
"But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?"
You're gonna have to find yourself
"Another best friend, somehow"
"Now, don't you try an' move me"
You're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee
"And, mama, you've been refused"
"Well, it's sugar for sugar"
And salt for salt
If you go down in the flood
It's gonna be your own fault
"Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?"
You're gonna have to find yourself
"Another best friend, somehow"
"Well, that high tide's risin'"
"Mama, don't you let me down"
Pack up your suitcase
"Mama, don't you make a sound"
"Now, it's king for king"
Queen for queen
It's gonna be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen
"Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?"
"Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself"
"Another best friend, somehow										 "
"			John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore"
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mamas face broke out all in a grin
"Oh son, you look so fine, Im glad youre a son of mine"
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
"Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get"
And well put them on the wall when you come home
"As that old train pulled out, Johns ma began to shout"
Tellin evryone in the neighborhood:
"Thats my son thats about to go, hes a soldier now, you know"
She made well sure her neighbors understood
She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!
"Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come"
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
"Then a letter finally came saying, Go down and meet the train"
Your sons a-coming home from the war
"She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around"
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
"But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last"
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes
Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
"He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know"
While she couldnt even recognize his face!
Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face
"Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done"
How is it you come to be this way?
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away
"Dont you remember, Ma, when I went off to war"
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
"I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud"
You wasnt there standing in my shoes
"Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?"
Im a-tryin to kill somebody or die tryin
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine
Oh! Lord! Just like mine!
"And I couldnt help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink"
That I was just a puppet in a play
"And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away
"As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock"
At seein the metal brace that helped him stand
"But as he turned to go, he called his mother close"
"And he dropped his medals down into her hand										 "
"			The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course"
The city fathers theyre trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Reveres horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce
Mamas in the factry
She aint got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin for the fuse
Im in the streets
With the tombstone blues
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
"Screaming she moans, Ive just been made"
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
"Says, My advice is to not let the boys in"
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride"
"You will not die, its not poison"
Mamas in the factry
She aint got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin for the fuse
Im in the streets
With the tombstone blues
"Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief"
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
"Saying, Tell me great hero, but please make it brief"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
"Saying, Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky
"Saying, The suns not yellow its chicken"
Mamas in the factry
She aint got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin for the fuse
Im in the streets
With the tombstone blues
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle
Mamas in the factry
She aint got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin for the fuse
Im in the streets
With the tombstone blues
The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
Causes Galileos math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after
Mamas in the factry
She aint got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin for the fuse
Im in the streets
With the tombstone blues
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
Mamas in the factry
She aint got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin for the fuse
Im in the streets
"With the tombstone blues										 "
"			Well you're comin' down High Street, walkin' in the sun"
"You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one"
"Jolene, Jolene"
"Baby, I am the king and you're the queen"
"Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end"
"I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again"
"I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line"
"You probably don't know, but I'm gonna make you mine"
"Jolene, Jolene     "
"Baby, I am the king and you're the queen"
"I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along"
"People think they know, but they're all wrong"
"You're something nice, I'm gonna grab my dice"
I can't say I haven't paid the price
"Jolene, Jolene"
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
"Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill"
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
"Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark"
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
"Jolene, Jolene"
"Baby I am the king and you're the queen										 "
"			Well, Im hangin on to a solid rock"
Made before the foundation of the world
"And I wont let go, and I cant let go, wont let go"
"And I cant let go, wont let go and I cant let go no more"
"For me He was chastised, for me He was hated"
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
"Nations are angry, cursed are some"
People are expecting a false peace to come
"Well, Im hangin on to a solid rock"
Made before the foundation of the world
"And I wont let go and I cant let go, wont let go"
"And I cant let go, wont let go and I cant let go no more"
Its the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun
And He never give up til the battles lost or won
"Well, Im hangin on to a solid rock"
Made before the foundation of the world
"And I wont let go and I cant let go, wont let go"
"And I cant let go, wont let go and I cant let go no more										 "
"			Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby"
Cant buy a thrill
"Well, Ive been up all night, baby"
Leanin on the windowsill
"Well, if I die"
On top of the hill
And if I dont make it
You know my baby will
"Dont the moon look good, mama"
Shinin through the trees?
"Dont the brakeman look good, mama"
Flagging down the Double E?
Dont the sun look good
Goin down over the sea?
Dont my gal look fine
When shes comin after me?
Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
"Well, I wanna be your lover, baby"
I dont wanna be your boss
Dont say I never warned you
"When your train gets lost										 "
"			Well, today has been a sad ol lonesome day"
"Yeah, today has been a sad ol lonesome day"
Im just sittin here thinking
With my mind a million miles away
"Well, theyre doing the double shuffle, throwin sand on the floor"
"Theyre doing the double shuffle, theyre throwin sand on the floor"
When I left my long-time darlin
She was standing in the door
"Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war"
"Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war"
"My sister, she ran off and got married"
Never was heard of any more
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months
Dont know how it looked to other people
I never slept with her even once
"Well, the roads washed outweather not fit for man or beast"
Yeah the roads washed outweather not fit for man or beast
"Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with"
Are the things you need the least
Im forty miles from the millIm droppin it into overdrive
Im forty miles from the millIm droppin it into overdrive
Settin my dial on the radio
I wish my mother was still alive
I see your lover-man comincomin cross the barren field
I see your lover-man comincomin cross the barren field
Hes not a gentleman at allhes rotten to the core
Hes a coward and he steals
Well my captain hes decoratedhes well schooled and hes skilled
"My captain, hes decoratedhes well schooled and hes skilled"
Hes not sentimentaldont bother him at all
How many of his pals have been killed
"Last night the wind was whisperin, I was trying to make out what it was"
Last night the wind was whisperin somethinI was trying to make out what it was
I tell myself somethings comin
But it never does
Im gonna spare the defeatedIm gonna speak to the crowd
"Im gonna spare the defeated, boys, Im going to speak to the crowd"
I am goin to teach peace to the conquered
Im gonna tame the proud
Well the leaves are rustlin in the woodthings are fallin off of the shelf
Leaves are rustlin in the woodthings are fallin off the shelf
"You gonna need my help, sweetheart"
"You cant make love all by yourself										 "
"			Standing on the waters casting your bread"
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
"But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?"
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
"Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman"
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
"Both of their futures, so full of dread, you dont show one"
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
"Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman"
"Youre a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds"
"Manipulator of crowds, youre a dream twister"
Youre going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Aint nobody there would want to marry your sister
"Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame"
"You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name"
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
"Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman"
"Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy"
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed couldve carved out your features
"Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space"
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
"Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman"
"Well, the riflemans stalking the sick and the lame"
"Preacherman seeks the same, wholl get there first is uncertain"
"Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks"
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time til night comes steppin in
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
"Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman"
"Its a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey"
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
"Hell put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat"
Take the motherless children off the street 
And place them at the feet of a harlot
"Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants"
"Oh, Jokerman, you dont show any response"
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
"Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman										 "
"			The man in me will do nearly any task"
"And as for compensation, theres little he would ask"
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me
"But, oh, what a wonderful feeling"
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein seen
But thats just because he doesnt want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
"To get through to the man in me										 "
"			Man gave names to all the animals"
"In the beginning, in the beginning"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, long time ago"
He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
"Ah, think Ill call it a bear"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, in the beginning"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, long time ago"
He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk comin out but he didnt know how
"Ah, think Ill call it a cow"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, in the beginning"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, long time ago"
He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they werent too short
It looked like there wasnt nothin that he couldnt pull
"Ah, think Ill call it a bull"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, in the beginning"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, long time ago"
He saw an animal leavin a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasnt too small and he wasnt too big
"Ah, think Ill call it a pig"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, in the beginning"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, long time ago"
Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
"Ah, think Ill call it a sheep"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, in the beginning"
Man gave names to all the animals
"In the beginning, long time ago"
He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
"Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake . . .										 "
"			Shadows are falling and Ive been here all day"
"Its too hot to sleep, time is running away"
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
Ive still got the scars that the sun didnt heal
Theres not even room enough to be anywhere
"Its not dark yet, but its getting there"
"Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain"
Behind every beautiful thing theres been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing what was in her mind
I just dont see why I should even care
"Its not dark yet, but its getting there"
"Well, Ive been to London and Ive been to gay Paree"
Ive followed the river and I got to the sea
Ive been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
I aint looking for nothing in anyones eyes
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear
"Its not dark yet, but its getting there"
I was born here and Ill die here against my will
"I know it looks like Im moving, but Im standing still"
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
I cant even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Dont even hear a murmur of a prayer
"Its not dark yet, but its getting there										 "
"			Your breath is sweet"
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
"Your back is straight, your hair is smooth"
On the pillow where you lie
But I dont sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy hes an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
Hell teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
Youve never learned to read or write
Theres no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee fore I go
"To the valley below										 "
"			There was a little boy and there was a little girl"
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
One summers day he came passing by
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And one day he came passing by
"Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new"
"Someday little girl, youll have a diamond as big as your shoe"
"Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high"
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
"Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high"
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
This is the blind horse that leads you around
"Let the bird sing, let the bird fly"
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
"Let the bird sing, let the bird fly"
"The man in the moon went home and the river went dry										 "
"			God dont make no promises that He dont keep"
"You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep"
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
"Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissingers got you tied up in knots"
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
"You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled"
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs thatll never cure your ills
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You got men who cant hold their peace and women who cant control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think Hes just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You cant take it with you and you know that its too worthless to be sold
"They tell you, Time is money, as if your life was worth its weight in gold"
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Theres a Man up on a cross and Hes been crucified
Do you have any idea why or for who He died?
"When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up"
"When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?										 "
"			In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light"
Where wisdom grows up in strife
"My bewildering brain, toils in vain"
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
"We live and we die, we know not why"
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down 
"We eat and we drink, we feel and we think"
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
"Soul to soul, our shadows roll"
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
The moon gives light and shines by night
I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O'er the road we're bound to go
"More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours"
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
"I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys"
I know they're not what they seem
"In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain"
You'll never see me frown
"I owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true"
"And I'll be with you when the deal goes down										 "
"			The air is getting hotter"
Theres a rumbling in the skies
Ive been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesnt haunt me like it did before
Ive been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
Ive been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin
Like pendulums swinging on chains
I tried to give you everything
That your heart was longing for
Im just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Im going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I dont know what all right even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
"I been all around the world, boys"
Now Im trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
Ill close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
"I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down"
"Now Im trying to get to heaven before they close the door										 "
"			Throw my ticket out the window"
"Throw my suitcase out there, too"
Throw my troubles out the door
I dont need them anymore
Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
"Oh, your love comes on so strong"
And Ive waited all day long
For tonight when Ill be staying here with you
Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave
I can hear that whistle blowin
"I see that stationmaster, too"
If theres a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you
Throw my ticket out the window
"Throw my suitcase out there, too"
Throw my troubles out the door
I dont need them anymore
"Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you										 "
"			Lost John sitting on a railroad track"
Something's out of wack
Blues this morning falling down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trail
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
"If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive"
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
"I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side"
"Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore"
And my happiness is o'er
"Winter's gone, the river's on the rise"
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here that's left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
The world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
"Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell"
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell
I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the two
"She says, ""look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants."
"You can get wrecked in this dance."""
"They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will"
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill
"Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore"
And my happiness is o'er
"Winter's gone, the river's on the rise"
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here that's left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite
"The Judge is coming in, everybody rise"
Lift up your eyes
"You can do what you please, you don't need my advice"
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice
"Getting light outside, the temperature dropped"
I think the rain has stopped
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
"When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight"
"Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore"
And my happiness is o'er
"Winter's gone, the river's on the rise"
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here that's left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
The bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day
Everything I've ever known to be right has proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
"The woman I'm lovin', she rules my heart"
No knife could ever cut our love apart
Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
"The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light"
I wish to God that it were night
"Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore"
And my happiness is o'er
"Winter's gone, the river's on the rise"
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here that's left to tell
"The world has gone black before my eyes										 "
"			Just like old Saxophone Joe"
When hes got the hogshead up on his toe
"Oh me, oh my"
Love that country pie
Listen to the fiddler play
When hes playin til the break of day
"Oh me, oh my"
Love that country pie
"Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime"
What do I care?
"Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum"
"Call me for dinner, honey, Ill be there"
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on er and turn her loose
"Oh me, oh my"
Love that country pie
I dont need much and that aint no lie
Aint runnin any race
Give to me my country pie
I wont throw it up in anybodys face
Shake me up that old peach tree
Little Jack Horners got nothin on me
"Oh me, oh my"
"Love that country pie										 "
"			I got my back to the sun cause the light is too intense"
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
"You cant turn backyou cant come back, sometimes we push too far"
One day youll open up your eyes and youll see where we are
Sugar Baby get on down the road
"You aint got no brains, no how"
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
"Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff"
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide em bad enough
"Im staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, shes not really my aunt"
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you cant
Sugar Baby get on down the line
"You aint got no brains, no how"
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now
"The ladies down in Darktown, theyre doing the Darktown Strut"
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There aint no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
"Love is pleasing, love is teasing, loves not an evil thing"
"Sugar Baby, get on down the road"
"You aint got no brains, no how"
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
"Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse"
"Sugar Baby, get on down the road"
"You aint got no brains, no how"
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
"You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done"
"Just as sure as were living, just as sure as youre born"
"Look up, look upseek your Makerfore Gabriel blows his horn"
"Sugar Baby, get on down the line"
"You aint got no sense, no how"
You went years without me
"Might as well keep going now										 "
"			Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted"
Cant help but wonder whats happenin to my companions
Are they lost or are they found
Have they counted the cost itll take to bring down
All their earthly principles theyre gonna have to abandon?
"Theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend"
I had a woman down in Alabama
"She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic"
"She said, Boy, without a doubt"
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
"You could die down here, be just another accident statistic"
"Theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend"
All that foreign oil controlling American soil
"Look around you, its just bound to make you embarrassed"
Sheiks walkin around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding Americas future from Amsterdam and to Paris
"And theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend"
"Mans ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they dont apply no more"
You cant rely no more to be standin around waitin'
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turnin over in his grave
"Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan"
"And theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend"
"Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters"
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All nonbelievers and men stealers talkin in the name of religion
"And theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend"
"People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting"
"Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it"
They say lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
"Theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend"
"Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin boy she could destroy"
"A real suicide case, but there was nothin I could do to stop it"
I dont care about economy
I dont care about astronomy
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
"Theres a slow, slow train comin up around the bend										 "
"			Seen a shooting star tonight"
And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
"Listen to the engine, listen to the bell"
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by
All good people are praying
"Its the last temptation, the last account"
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow will be 
Another day
Guess its too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight
"Slip away										 "
"			To be alone with you"
Just you and me
Now wont you tell me true
Aint that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Evrything is always right
When Im alone with you
To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while lifes pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when Im alone with you
They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But youre always what Im thinkin of
I wish the night were here
Bringin me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms
Ill always thank the Lord
When my working days through
I get my sweet reward
"To be alone with you										 "
"			There was a wicked messenger"
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
"For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter"
He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
"The soles of my feet, I swear theyre burning"
"Oh, the leaves began to fallin"
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
"If ye cannot bring good news, then dont bring any										 "
"			Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith"
"A nasty, dirty, double-crossin, backstabbin phony I didnt wanna have to be dealin with"
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
"Well, I cried for younow its your turn to cry awhile"
I dont carry deadweightIm no flash in the pan
"All right, Ill set you straight, cant you see Im a union man?"
"Im lettin the cat out of the cage, Im keeping a low profile"
"Well, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile"
Feel like a fighting roosterfeel better than I ever felt
But the Pennsylvania lines in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
"I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile"
"Well, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile"
Last night cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin a two A.M. booty call
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
"Well, I cried for younow its your turn to cry awhile"
"Im on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I cant control"
"Some people they aint human, they got no heart or soul"
"Well, Im crying to the LordIm tryin to be meek and mild"
"Yes, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile"
"Well, theres preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs"
Im longin for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
Im gonna buy me a barrel of whiskeyIll die before I turn senile
"Well, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile"
"Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way"
I always said youd be sorry and today could be the day
"I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial"
"Well, I cried for you, now its your turn, you can cry awhile										 "
"			If your memry serves you well"
We were goin to meet again and wait
So Im goin to unpack all my things
And sit before it gets too late
No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell
But you know that we shall meet again
If your memry serves you well
This wheels on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!
If your memry serves you well
I was goin to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailors knot
And hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
But it was oh so hard to tell
But you knew that we would meet again
If your memry serves you well
This wheels on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!
If your memry serves you well
Youll remember youre the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done
And after evry plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell
You knew that we would meet again
If your memry served you well
This wheels on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
"This wheel shall explode!										 "
"			Johnnys in the basement"
Mixing up the medicine
Im on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
"Badge out, laid off"
Says hes got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
Its somethin you did
God knows when
But youre doin it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
By the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phones tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
Look out kid
Dont matter what you did
Walk on your tiptoes
Dont try No-Doz
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You dont need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows
"Get sick, get well"
Hang around a ink well
"Ring bell, hard to tell"
If anything is goin to sell
"Try hard, get barred"
"Get back, write braille"
"Get jailed, jump bail"
"Join the army, if you fail"
Look out kid
Youre gonna get hit
"But users, cheaters"
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin for a new fool
Dont follow leaders
Watch the parkin meters
"Ah get born, keep warm"
"Short pants, romance, learn to dance"
"Get dressed, get blessed"
Try to be a success
"Please her, please him, buy gifts"
"Dont steal, dont lift"
Twenty years of schoolin
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Dont wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Dont wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump dont work
"Cause the vandals took the handles										 "
"			As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden"
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines
I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Through this weary world of woe
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
No one on earth would ever know
They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I'm trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
"But oh, mother, things ain't going well"
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
They'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
"My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry"
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Through the world mysterious and vague
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
Walking through the cities of the plague
The whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Eatin' hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town
Heart burnin'  still yearnin'
Someday you'll be glad to have me around
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every waking moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death then I'll step back
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Hand me down my walkin' cane
"Heart burnin', still yearnin' "
Got to get you out of my miserable brain
All my loyal and much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
"My mule is sick, my horse is blind"
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
Thinkin' bout that gal I left behind
It's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire's gone out but the light is never dying
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Carrying a dead man's shield 
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel
The suffering is unending
Every nook and cranny has it's tears
"I'm not playing, I'm not pretending"
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Walkin' ever since the other night
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
Walkin' til I'm clean out of sight
As I walked out in the mystic garden
"On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn"
"Excuse me, ma'am I beg your pardon"
"There's no one here, the gardener is gone"
"Ain't talkin', just walkin'"
Up the road around the bend
"Heart burnin', still yearnin'"
"In the last outback, at the world's end										  "
"			Clouds so swift"
Rain wont lift
Gate wont close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You aint goin nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrows the day
My brides gonna come
"Oh, oh, are we gonna fly"
Down in the easy chair!
I dont care
How many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You aint goin nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrows the day
My brides gonna come
"Oh, oh, are we gonna fly"
Down in the easy chair!
Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To the tree with roots
You aint goin nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrows the day
My brides gonna come
"Oh, oh, are we gonna fly"
Down in the easy chair!
Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
Well climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrows the day
My brides gonna come
"Oh, oh, are we gonna fly"
"Down in the easy chair!										 "
"			Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle til the moon is blue"
Wiggle til the moon sees you
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees"
Wiggle on your hands and knees
"Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear"
Wiggle til you wiggle right out of here
"Wiggle til it opens, wiggle til it shuts"
"Wiggle til it bites, wiggle til it cuts"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead"
Wiggleyou can raise the dead
"Wiggle til youre high, wiggle til youre higher"
Wiggle til you vomit fire
"Wiggle til it whispers, wiggle til it hums"
"Wiggle til it answers, wiggle til it comes"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk"
"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake"
"Wiggle like a big fat snake										 "
"			If dogs run free, then why not we"
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
"Of two mules, trains and rain"
The best is always yet to come
Thats what they explain to me
"Just do your thing, youll be king"
If dogs run free
"If dogs run free, why not me"
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
"Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee"
So it may flow and be
"To each his own, its all unknown"
If dogs run free
"If dogs run free, then what must be"
"Must be, and that is all"
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall
In harmony with the cosmic sea
True love needs no company
"It can cure the soul, it can make it whole"
"If dogs run free										 "
"			Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on"
"Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon"
"He was an outlaw, thats for sure"
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirits livin on and on
"Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldnt work out"
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
"Hes on some other shore, he didnt wanna live anymore"
Lenny Bruce is dead but he didnt commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
I rode with him in a taxi once
"Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months"
"Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone"
They said that he was sick cause he didnt play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
"Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had										 "
"			If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?"
Guess I owe You some kind of apology
"Ive escaped death so many times, I know Im only living"
By the saving grace thats over me
By this time Id-a thought I would be sleeping
In a pine box for all eternity
"My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping"
For the saving grace thats over me
"Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection"
Wherever I am welcome is where Ill be
"I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection"
Is the saving grace thats over me
"Well, the devils shining light, it can be most blinding"
"But to search for love, that aint no more than vanity"
As I look around this world all that Im finding
Is the saving grace thats over me
The wicked know no peace and you just cant fake it
Theres only one road and it leads to Calvary
"It gets discouraging at times, but I know Ill make it"
"By the saving grace thats over me										 "
"			I aint lookin to compete with you"
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
"Simplify you, classify you"
"Deny, defy or crucify you"
All I really want to do
"Is, baby, be friends with you"
"No, and I aint lookin to fight with you"
Frighten you or tighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
"Is, baby, be friends with you"
I aint lookin to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
"Analyze you, categorize you"
Finalize you or advertise you
All I really want to do
"Is, baby, be friends with you"
I dont want to straight-face you
"Race or chase you, track or trace you"
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do
"Is, baby, be friends with you"
I dont want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
"Is, baby, be friends with you"
I dont want to fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I aint lookin for you to feel like me
See like me or be like me
All I really want to do
"Is, baby, be friends with you										 "
"			The seasons they are turnin and my sad heart is yearnin"
To hear again the songbirds sweet melodious tone
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
"The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan"
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
"Well, Im preachin peace and harmony"
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
Ill take you cross the river dear
Youve no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like
The clouds are turnin crimsonthe leaves fall from the limbs an
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
"The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees"
"The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown"
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
The trailing moss and mystic glow
Purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
"Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief"
It takes a thief to catch a thief
"For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me"
My pulse is runnin through my palmthe sharp hills are rising from
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
"Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?										 "
"			You have given everything to me"
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see
What can I do for You?
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
And Youve chosen me to be among the few
What can I do for You?
You have laid down Your life for me
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery
What can I do for You?
"Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly"
He gets wise in his own eyes and hes made to believe a lie
Who would deliver him from the death hes bound to die?
"Well, Youve done it all and theres no more anyone can pretend to do"
What can I do for You?
You have given all there is to give
What can I do for You?
You have given me life to live
How can I live for You?
"I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts"
"I dont care how rough the road is, show me where it starts"
"Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart"
"Well, I dont deserve it but I sure did make it through"
"What can I do for You?										 "
"			Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble"
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that youre seein double
"On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs"
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where Ive got me a date with Botticellis niece
She promised that shed be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece
"Oh, the hours Ive spent inside the Coliseum"
Dodging lions and wastin time
"Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see em"
"Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb"
Train wheels runnin through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
"Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody"
When I paint my masterpiece
Sailin round the world in a dirty gondola
"Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!"
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
"Someday, everything is gonna be diffrent"
"When I paint my masterpiece										  "
"			If not for you"
"Babe, I couldnt find the door"
Couldnt even see the floor
Id be sad and blue
If not for you
If not for you
"Babe, Id lay awake all night"
Wait for the mornin light
To shine in through
But it would not be new
If not for you
If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love Id be nowhere at all
Id be lost if not for you
And you know its true
If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love Id be nowhere at all
Oh! what would I do
If not for you
If not for you
Winter would have no spring
Couldnt hear the robin sing
I just wouldnt have a clue
Anyway it wouldnt ring true
"If not for you										 "
"			If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier"
"She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear"
Say for me that Im all right though things get kind of slow
"She might think that Ive forgotten her, dont tell her it isnt so"
"We had a falling-out, like lovers often will"
"And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill"
"And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart"
"She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart"
"If you get close to her, kiss her once for me"
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free
"Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way"
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
"And Ive never gotten used to it, Ive just learned to turn it off"
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft
"Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past"
"I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast"
"If shes passin back this way, I'm not that hard to find"
"Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time										 "
"			Down over the window"
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleysthrough the blinds
Another one of them endless days
Honey bees are buzzin
Leaves begin to stir
Im in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her
I keep listenin for footsteps
But I aint hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
"I catch a lot, sometimes too many"
A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin in
Sometimes its just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind
"The old men round here, sometimes they get"
On bad terms with the younger men
"But old, young, age dont carry weight"
It doesnt matter in the end
One of the boss hangers-on
Comes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully yastrong-arm youinspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect
Theres a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot-six across
Burns with the bark still on
"They say times are hard, if you dont believe it"
You can just follow your nose
It dont bother metimes are hard everywhere
Well just have to see how it goes
"My old man, hes like some feudal lord"
Got more lives than a cat
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat
You can smell the pinewood burnin
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you wanna learn anything
"Romeo, he said to Juliet, You got a poor complexion"
It doesnt give your appearance a very youthful touch!
"Juliet said back to Romeo, Why dont you just shove off"
If it bothers you so much
They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
"They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee"
All the rest of them rebel rivers
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
Im not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
Ive seen enough heartaches and strife
My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I dont know if they had any dreams or hopes
"I had em once though, I suppose, to go along"
With all the ring-dancin Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves
Its not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a whileit can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
"And tears or not, its too much to ask										 "
"			Gonna change my way of thinking"
Make myself a different set of rules
Gonna change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Gonna put my good foot forward
And stop being influenced by fools
So much oppression
Cant keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Cant keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
And old men turning young daughters into whores
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land
Well dont know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Well dont know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
But theres only one authority
And thats the authority on high
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
She can do the Georgia crawl
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord
"Jesus said, Be ready"
For you know not the hour in which I come
"Jesus said, Be ready"
For you know not the hour in which I come
"He said, He who is not for Me is against Me"
Just so you know where Hes coming from
Theres a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
Theres a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth

About the same time He made the earth

Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
"She said, Lord, have mercy, honey"
Im so glad youre my boy!
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand.
Evrybody watchin us go by

"			I was blinded by the devil"
Born already ruined
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb
By His grace I have been touched
By His word I have been healed
By His hand Ive been delivered
By His spirit Ive been sealed
Ive been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And Im so glad
"Yes, Im so glad"
Im so glad
So glad
"I want to thank You, Lord"
"I just want to thank You, Lord"
"Thank You, Lord"
By His truth I can be upright
By His strength I do endure
By His power Ive been lifted
In His love I am secure
He bought me with a price
Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it
Ive been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved

Nobody would dare
I was going down for the last time
But by His mercy Ive been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long Ive been hindered
For so long Ive been stalled
Ive been saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
By the blood of the lamb
Saved
Saved
And Im so glad
"Yes, Im so glad"
Im so glad
So glad

"			Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when"
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
"When they asked him why it had to be that way, Well, he answered,"
just because
"Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last"
"They called Joe Crazy, the baby they called Kid Blast"
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue
"Joey, Joey"
"King of the streets, child of clay"
"Joey, Joey"
What made them want to come and blow you away?
"There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that"
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
"When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof"
"He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin he was bulletproof"
"The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets"
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
"They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs"
The hostages were tremblin when they heard a man exclaim
"Lets blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame"
"But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, Were not those kind of men"
Its peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again
"Joey, Joey"
"King of the streets, child of clay"
"Joey, Joey"
What made them want to come and blow you away?
"The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith"
"They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with"
What time is it? said the judge to Joey when they met
"Five to ten, said Joey. The judge says, Thats exactly what you get"
"He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich"
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men cause they seemed to understand
What its like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
When they let him out in 71 hed lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
"To the boss he said, I have returned and now I want whats mine"
"Joey, Joey"
"King of the streets, child of clay"
"Joey, Joey"
Why did they have to come and blow you away?
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
"Im around too many children, hed say, they should never know of one"
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
"Emptied out the register, said, Tell em it was Crazy Joe"
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it comin through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy
"Joey, Joey"
"King of the streets, child of clay"
"Joey, Joey"
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
"I heard his best friend Frankie say, He aint dead, hes just asleep"
Then I saw the old mans limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if Gods in heaven overlookin His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve
"Joey, Joey"
"King of the streets, child of clay"
"Joey, Joey"
"What made them want to come and blow you away?										 "
"			We carried you in our arms"
On Independence Day
And now youd throw us all aside
And put us on our way
Oh what dear daughter neath the sun
Would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot
"And always tell him, No?"
"Tears of rage, tears of grief"
Why must I always be the thief?
"Come to me now, you know"
Were so alone
And life is brief
We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
"Now, I want you to know that while we watched"
You discover there was no one true
Most evrybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do
"Tears of rage, tears of grief"
Must I always be the thief?
"Come to me now, you know"
Were so low
And life is brief
It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
"But, oh, what kind of love is this"
Which goes from bad to worse?
"Tears of rage, tears of grief"
Must I always be the thief?
"Come to me now, you know"
Were so low
"And life is brief										  "
"			Cant you hear that rooster crowin?"
Rabbit runnin down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
"On this new morning, new morning"
On this new morning with you
Cant you hear that motor turnin?
Automobile comin into style
Comin down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
"On this new morning, new morning"
On this new morning with you
The night passed away so quickly
It always does when youre with me
Cant you feel that sun a-shinin?
Groundhog runnin by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
"On this new morning, new morning"
On this new morning with you
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
"On this new morning, new morning"
On this new morning with you
"New morning . . .										 "
"			Ive just reached a place"
Where the willow dont bend
Theres not much more to be said
Its the top of the end
Im going
Im going
Im gone
Im closin the book
On the pages and the text
And I dont really care
What happens next
Im just going
Im going
Im gone
I been hangin on threads
I been playin it straight
"Now, Ive just got to cut loose"
Before it gets late
So Im going
Im going
Im gone
"Grandma said, Boy, go and follow your heart"
And youll be fine at the end of the line
All thats gold isnt meant to shine
Dont you and your one true love ever part

I been livin on the edge

Before I get to the ledge
So Im going
Im just going
"Im gone										 "
"			Bye and bye, Im breathin a lovers sigh"
Im sittin on my watch so I can be on time
Im singin loves praises with sugar-coated rhyme
"Bye and bye, on you Im casting my eye"
Im paintin the townswinging my partner around
"I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust"
"Im watchin the roads, Im studying the dust"
Im paintin the town making my last go-round
"Well, Im scufflin and Im shufflin and Im walkin on briars"
Im not even acquainted with my own desires
Im rollin slowIm doing all I know
Im tellin myself I found true happiness
That Ive still got a dream that hasnt been repossessed
"Im rollin slow, goin where the wild roses grow"
Well the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last
"Papa gone mad, mamma, shes feeling sad"
Im gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
Im gonna establish my rule through civil war
"Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be										 "
"			I have heard rumors all over town"
They say that youre planning to put me down
All I would like you to do
Is tell me that it isnt true
They say that youve been seen with some other man
"That hes tall, dark and handsome, and youre holding his hand"
"Darlin, Im a-countin on you"
Tell me that it isnt true
To know that some other man is holdin you tight
"It hurts me all over, it doesnt seem right"
All of those awful things that I have heard
"I dont want to believe them, all I want is your word"
"So darlin, you better come through"
Tell me that it isnt true
All of those awful things that I have heard
"I dont want to believe them, all I want is your word"
"So darlin, Im countin on you"
"Tell me that it isnt true										 "
"			When your mother sends back all your invitations"
And your father to your sister he explains
That youre tired of yourself and all of your creations
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And youre sick of all this repetition
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
When all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody you dont have to speak to
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?"
"Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?										 "
"			I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
Dont need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
"Dont need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees"
Dont need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
"Dont need a shot of whiskey, help me be president"
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
"Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid"
I seen the kingdoms of the world and its makin me feel afraid
"What I got aint painful, its just bound to kill me dead"
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
I dont need no alibi when Im spending time with you
Ive heard all of them rumors and you have heard em too
Dont show me no picture show or give me no book to read
It dont satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
Why would I want to take your life?
"Youve only murdered my father, raped his wife"
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
"Mocked my God, humiliated my friends"
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
Dont wanna be with nobody tonight
"Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just aint right"
"Theres a man that hates me and hes swift, smooth and near"
Am I supposed to set back and wait until hes here?
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Dont even feel like crossing the street and my car aint actin right
"Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away"
My conscience is beginning to bother me today
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love"
"If youre a doctor, I need a shot of love										 "
"			Every step of the way we walk the line"
"Your days are numbered, so are mine"

"Were all boxed in, nowhere to escape"
Citys just a jungle; more games to play
"Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away"
"I was raised in the country, I been workin in the town"
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down
"Got nothin' for you, I had nothin' before"
Dont even have anything for myself anymore
"Sky full of fire, pain pourin down"
"Nothing you can sell me, Ill see you around"
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
"Well, the devils in the alley, mules in the stall"
"Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all"
I was thinkin 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosies bed
"Walkin' through the leaves, falling from the trees"
Feelin' like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
"I know youre sorry, Im sorry too"
Some people will offer you their hand and some wont
"Last night I knew you, tonight I dont"
I need somethin strong to distract my mind
Im gonna look at you til my eyes go blind
Well I got here followin' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Well my ships been split to splinters and its sinkin' fast
"Im drownin in the poison, got no future, got no past"
"But my heart is not weary, its light and its free"
Ive got nothin but affection for all those whove sailed with me
Everybody movin if they aint already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
"Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow"
Things should start to get interestin' right about now
"My clothes are wet, tight on my skin"
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waitin to be kind
So give me your hand and say youll be mine
"Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay"
"You can always come back, but you cant come back all the way"
Only one thing I did wrong
"Stayed in Mississippi a day too long										  "
"			You took a part of me that I really miss"
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
"You told yourself a lie, thats all right mama I told myself one too"
Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you
"You took the silver, you took the gold"
You left me standing out in the cold
"People ask about you, I didnt tell them everything I knew"
"Well, Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you"
Im drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
"Well, Im tryin to get closer but Im still a million miles from you"
"I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low"
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what its all coming to
"Well, Im tryin to get closer but Im still a million miles from you"
"Well, I dont dare close my eyes and I dont dare wink"
Maybe in the next life Ill be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just dont know who
"Well, Im tryin to get closer but Im still a million miles from you"
The last thing you said before you hit the street
Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet
"I said, Thats all right mama . . . you . . . you do what you gotta do"
"Well, Im tryin to get closer. Im still a million miles from you"
"Rock me, pretty baby, rock me til everything gets real"
"Rock me for a little while, rock me til theres nothing left to feel"
And Ill rock you too
Im tryin to get closer but Im still a million miles from you
"Well, theres voices in the night trying to be heard"
Im sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
"Yes, Im tryin to get closer but Im still a million miles from you										 "
"			Precious angel, under the sun"
How was I to know youd be the one

Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there aint no neutral ground

"Shine your light, shine your light on me"
"Shine your light, shine your light on me"
"Shine your light, shine your light on me"
Ya know I just couldnt make it by myself
Im a little too blind to see
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell
"They look me squarely in the eye and they say, All is well"
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them and they wont be able to die?
"Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw"
"You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law"
"You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed"
in the same breath
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminals death
"Shine your light, shine your light on me"
"Shine your light, shine your light on me"
"Shine your light, shine your light on me"
Ya know I just couldnt make it by myself

"We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves"
Let us hope theyve found mercy in their bone-filled graves

"Youre the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night"
"But theres violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed"

Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
That I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close I move away I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
"But if you really want me, move slow"
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
"Treat you right, be with you day and night Baby all I need is time I don't wanna be so shy"
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
"But if you really want me, move slow"
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
"Treat you right, be with you day and night All I really want is to hold you tight"
"Treat you right, be with you day and night"
Baby all I need is time Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
"If you love me, trust in me"
The way that I trust in you Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight (hold you tight)
"Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night) Sometimes I run (sometimes)"
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
"Treat you right, be with you day and night All I really want is to hold you tight"
Be with you day and night
"Sometimes I run, (sometimes) sometimes I hide"

He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart But mama I'm in love with a criminal
"And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical"
"Mama please don't cry, I will be alright"
"All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy He is a villain by the devil's law"
"He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun"
That man's a snitch and unpredictable
"He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none"
"All I know, should've let go, but no"
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart But mama I'm in love with a criminal

Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break

"I, I'm stronger Lately I've been stuck imagining"
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
"I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way"
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
"I got running through my mind, whoa Lately people got me all tied up"
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
"I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way"
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
"I got running through my mind, whoa Shame on me"
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
"I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way"
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
"I got running through my mind, whoa Baby, I'm so into you"
"You've got that something, what can I do"
"Baby, you spin me around, oh"
"The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground"
Every time you look at me
"My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see"
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before [Chorus]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
"I'm so excited, I'm in too deep"
"Crazy, but it feels alright"
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
"Tell me, you're so into me"
That I'm the only one you will see
"Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh"
That I'm not wastin'
My feelins on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
Chorus
"Crazy, I just can't sleep"
"I'm so excited, I'm in too deep"
"Crazy, but it feels alright"
Every day and every night
"Chorus Hey, over there"
"Please, forgive me"
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
"But, you're winnin'"
And they're playin' my favorite song
"So, come here"
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
"'Cause, you feel like paradise"
And I need a vacation tonight
"So, if I said I want your body now"
"Would you hold it against me? Hey, you might think"
That I'm crazy
"But, you know I'm just your type"
I might be
Little hazy
"But, you just cannot deny"
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
"So, I'm askin' you tonight If I said my heart was beating loud"
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
"'Cause, you feel like paradise"
And I need a vacation tonight
"So, if I said I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me? If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
"Yeah, uh-huh, oh Give me somethin' good"
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
"'Cause, you feel like paradise"
And I need a vacation tonight
"So, if I said I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me? I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always
"Go my way, yeah"
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find
Her way (I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
"I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah"
(All I need is time) all I need is time
(A moment that is mine) that's mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time (is all I need)
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Oh
Not yet a woman Bring the action...

"All around the world, pretty girls"
"Jump the line, to the front"
"Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)"
"We're just so pretty! Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?"
From Australia 'round to LA
"You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow"
We be keeping them up on their toes
"They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes"
"Just you watch, they're so predictable"
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
"(Like bees to the honey!) All around the world, pretty girls"
Wipe the floor with all the boys
"Pour the drinks, bring the noise"

"All around the world, pretty girls"
"Jump the line, to the front"
"Do what we like, get what we want"
"We're just so pretty! Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?"
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
"Every time I walk out of my house it's like, ""hey, baby!"""
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
"(Like bees to the honey!) All around the world, pretty girls"
Wipe the floor with all the boys
"Pour the drinks, bring the noise"
We're just so pretty!
"All around the world, pretty girls"
"Jump the line, to the front"
"Do what we like, get what we want"
"We're just so pretty! If you ask me, I'm killing them softly"
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
"See, enter in line between the beauty and a beast"
"Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece"
"Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind"
"All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time"

"We're just so pretty! Never look back, we said"
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
"Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind"
Where do I go? And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
"Did you now, still I miss you somehow From the bottom of my broken heart"
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
"You were my real love, I never knew love"
'Til there was you
"From the bottom of my broken heart Baby, I said"
"Please stay, give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about But you put a dart through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
"You were my first love,"
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
"You were my real love, I never knew love"
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
"You were my real love, I never knew love"
'Til there was you
"From the bottom of my broken heart Never look back, we said"
How was I to know I'd miss you so? For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place
"At the same time, it's over now"
I spotted you dancing
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair
I should shake my thing
I make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you we're meant to be
"You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)"
"Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)"
"Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)"
"Boys, and when a girl is with one"
"Boys, then she's in control Took the boy off the dance floor"
Screaming in his ear
Must have said something 'bout me (what you say?)
Because he's looking over here
You looking at me with a sexy attitude
But the way your boys moving it
It puts me in the mood What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you were meant to be (don't you know?
"You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)"
"Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)"
"Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)"
"Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)"
"Boys, then she's in control (You like that? Here we go) Tonight, let's fly, boy have no fear (have no fear)"
There's no time to lose (What are you waiting for?)
"And next week, you may not see me here"
"So, boy, just make your move (let me see what you can do) Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one"
"Boys, to love her and to hold (the way you move)"
"Boys, and when a girl is with one"
"Boys, then she's in control Come with me, let's fly into the night"
"Oh boy, tonight is ours (It's just you and me, baby)"
"When hugging me, make sure you hold me tight"
Let's head for the stars
"Get nasty, oh Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one"
"Boys, to love her and to hold (Get nasty)"
"Boys, and when a girl is with one (Get nasty)"
"Boys, then she's in control Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em Pink:"

You're going to have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't want to be so damn protected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
"God, I need some answers What am I to do with my life?"
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
"But my life has been so overprotected I'll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don't"
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
"I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize"
I'm overprotected There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
"God, I need some answers What am I to do with my life?"
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I need time (love)
I need space
"(This is it, this is it) I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna"
"What I, what, what, what I'm going to"
Do about my destiny
"I say no, no, nobody's telling me just"
"What, what, what I wanna do, do"
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me (Action!) What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
"What I, what, what, what I'm going to"
Do about my destiny
"I say no, no, nobody's telling me just"
"What, what, what I wanna do, do"
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying in tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me I can't believe what I see (no....)
(The girl in my mirror)
The girl in my mirror is me
Ohh... is me 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do It's been a while
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
But I'm here now I know it's been a while
But I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout
How you say my name
Got my body spinning
Like a hurricane
And it feels like
You got me going insane
And I can't get enough
"So let me get it up Ooh, looks like we're alone now"
You ain't gotta be scared
Where you going now?
I'm a have to floss on you
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move you

But you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel

"So let me get it up Ooh, looks like we're alone now"
You ain't gotta be scared

"Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy"
Such a classic tale
"Current girl friend, ex girlfriend, I'm trying to be cool"
"Am I being paranoid, am I seeing things?"
Am I just insecure? I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
"of us in here baby CHORUS So I, wait for you to call"
And I try to act natural
have you been thinking 'bout her or about me
"And while I wait I put on my perfume, yeah I want it all over you"
"I gotta mark my territory I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume"
"I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells your perfume"
"I hide it well, hope you can't tell but I hope she smells my perfume"
"I hide it well, hope you can't tell but I hope she smells my perfume I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you"
Please don't forget me
"Do I imagine it, or catch these moments"
"I know you got history But I'm your girlfriend, now I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool"
"I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things"
That I'm just insecure I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
"of us in here baby CHORUS So I, wait for you to call"
And I try to act natural
have you been thinking 'bout her or about me
"And while I wait I put on my perfume, yeah I want it all over you"
"I gotta mark my territory I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume"
"I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells your perfume"

And think about the times that we've been through (oh my love)

Trying my best to understand I really want to know what we did wrong
With the love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd rather give it up than carry on (oh my love)
'Cause livin In a dream of you and me

"This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way"
"We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight"
Can tell you want me
"By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe"
No shame in the game
"Just cut the shit, be honest"
"Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight"
I just want you to make me move
"Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do"
Just want you to raise my roof
"Something sensational (sensational, oh yeah)"
"And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
"And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh No rules"
"From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room"
"Igniting the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse"
"Blowing up to the ceiling, we're burning bright"
When we cross the line
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in the sapphire sun
"There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight"
I just want you to make me move
"Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do"
Just want you to raise my roof

My heart's on fire when you're around
"Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
"(Yeah, Eazy) I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star"
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
"Listen, here we are, need you"
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
"I'm all jealous, you came with someone"
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
"That means you're speaking my language, come on"
"Now follow me, let's go"
Like Penelope in Blow
"Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know"
"That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah"
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
"To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah"
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you
"And make me ooh (move), ooh, ooh (yeah), ooh"
"And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
"Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out"
My heart's on fire when you're around
"Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
"Yeah, you make me ooh Confidence is a must"

"I ain't perfect, but you ain't either (who?) If your feeling froggy leap (oh)"
I ain't even losin' sleep (oh)

"(You will find it out, don't worry)"
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been
So overprotected I wanna see you move! With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
"Your toxic, I'm slipping under"
"With a taste of poison paradise,"
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that your toxic
And I love what you doin'
"Don't you know that your toxic I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too"
And I need to do what I feel like doing
"So let me go, and just listen All you people look at me like I'm a little girl"
Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world Always saying little girl don't step into the club
"Well I'm just tryin' to find out why 'cause dancing's what I love Get it get it, get it get it (oh)"
"Get it get it, get it get it (oh)"
"Get it get it, get it get it (oh) I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy"
"But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy What's practical is logical, what the hell, who cares?"
"All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there I'm a slave for you, I cannot hold it, I cannot control it"
"I'm a slave for you, I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me"
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
"Oh baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me"

"I cannot hold it, I cannot control it"
"I'm a slave for you, (here we go) I won't deny it, (yeah)"
I'm not trying to hide it (Like that) There was a time I was one of a kind
Lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien
I tried but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
"Ooh that was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home"
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
"Ooh That was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home"
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
"Not alone not alone not alone But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home"
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone - not alone not alone not alone) Ya!
"Yeah... Aay, shorty."
(Britney giggles) You're so sweet Britney:
"Stranger, A stranger"
"Candy from a stranger Excuse ma, but you're sick"
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss
"Come, be my desert in this"
I put my spoon in your dip
Oooh!
We got one night only
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me
Then she told me; Britney:
"I don't even know you But here, I got a snicker for you, here! [Chorus:]"
Britney:
"What's in front of me?, I just can't believe"
"Oh, you're tempting me"
(Oh oh 'cause you're so sweet)
It's been too long
"Oh, it feels so wrong"
"Danger, Danger, candy from a stranger You don't need to sugar coat it"
"I got it, and you know it"
All of the pieces with it
(mama told me don't) Take candy from strangers
Candy from strangers
"Candy from a stranger Shorty, have a bite"
I will fill your appetite
I know your mom said not to
"But, I'll change your life after tonight"
"Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it"
"And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't fight it"
Come give it to me [Chorus] [Bridge]
Britney:
A stranger Laze:
Come get some Britney:
A stranger Laze:
Just like that
A stranger
"Don't be scared, don't be scared [Bridge x2] Mama use to tell me"
Don't take candy from a stranger
"But girl, you look so sweet"
You got me reaching with my fingers
"She said don't take candy from a stranger,"
"candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger [Chorus x2] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah"
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
"Oh baby, baby Oops, I did it again"
"I played with your heart, got lost in the game"
"Oh baby, baby"
"Oops, you think I'm in love"
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
"Wishing that heroes, they truly exist"
"I cry, watching the days"
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
"Oh baby, oh Oops, I did it again"
"I played with your heart, got lost in the game"
"Oh baby, baby"
"Oops, you think I'm in love"
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah All aboard
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this?"
"Yeah, yes it is"
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"
"Aww, you shouldn't have Oops, I did it again to your heart"
"Got lost in this game, oh baby"
"Oops, you think that I'm sent from above"
"I'm not that innocent Oops, I did it again"
"I played with your heart, got lost in the game"
"Oh baby, baby"
"Oops, you think I'm in love"
That I'm sent from above
"I'm not that innocent Oops, I did it again"
"I played with your heart, got lost in the game"
"Oh baby, baby"
"Oops, you think I'm in love"
That I'm sent from above
"I'm not that innocent Baby, I'm so into you"
"You got that something, what can I do"
"Baby, you spin me around"
"Oh, the earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground Every time you look at me"
"My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see"
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
"I'm so excited, I'm in too deep"
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
"Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Oh oh"
"Tell me, you're so into me"
That I'm the only one you will see
"Tell me, I'm not in the blue, oh"
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
"I'm so excited, I'm in too deep"
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
"Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Crazy"
I just can't sleep
"I'm so excited, I'm in too deep"
Crazy
But it feels alright
"Every day and every night You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)"
"I'm so excited, I'm in too deep"
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
"Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)"
Yeah
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
"Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night"
"Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Nothing about you is typical"
Nothing about you is predictable
You've got me all twisted and confused
(It's all new)
"Up til now, I thought I knew love"
Nothing to loose and its damaged cause
"Patterns will fall as quick as I do, but now Bridges are burning"
"Baby I'm learning, a new way of thinking now"
"Love I can see, nothing will be, just like it was"
Is that because? Baby you're so unusual
"Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?"
"I expect you do, so why haven't you?"
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
"Sweet surprise, I could get used to"
Unusual You Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring trying to defend myself
In the private eye to see what's going on
(That's long gone)
"When I'm with you, I can just be myself"
You're always where you said you will be
Shocking cause I never knew love like this could exist Tables are turning
"My heart is soaring, You'll never let me down"
"Answer my call, here after all"
Never met anyone like you Baby you're so unusual
"Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?"
"I expect you do, so why haven't you?"
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
"Sweet surprise, I could get used to"
Unusual You Can't believe that I almost didn't try
When you call my name
Now everything has changed Baby you're so unusual
"Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?"
"I expect you do, so why haven't you?"
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
"Sweet surprise, I could get used to"
Unusual You Said you're gonna be here in a minute
"Sitting in the mirror, getting pretty"
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy You
Touch me and it's breaking me down
"And me down, and me down, and me down"
"I'm telling you, let's just give it up"
"And get down, and get down, and get down So come on"
Won't you give me something to remember?
"Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out"
Even though we couldn't last forever
"Baby, you know what I want right now Hit me one more time, it's so amazing"
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out
Inside out I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy You
"Touch me and it's breaking me down,"
"And me down, and me down, and me down"
"I'm telling you, let's just give it up"
"And get down, and get down, and get down So come on"

How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out
"Inside out, inside out So come on"
Won't you give me something to remember?
"Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out"
Even though we couldn't last forever
"Baby, you know what I want right now Hit me one more time, it's so amazing"
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy

Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win I can't go on as long as I believe
"Can't let go when I keep wondering Where are you now, what have you found"
"Where is your heart, when I'm not around"
"Where are you now, you gotta let me know"
"Oh baby, so I can let you go I can hear your voice"
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
"Revive my dignity But, I can't go on as long as I believe (as long as I believe)"
"Can't let go when I keep wondering Where are you now, what have you found"
"Where is your heart, when I'm not around"

Ive even read it in my script
But when I thought it wasnt fair
"I felt it on my lips, let go"
I dont wanna be the one
"I think you already know, oh The feeling of going down way too deep"
Holding on
So you wont lose your feet
Sometimes you just gotta trust
You gotta take that leap
And let go
Gotta let go Ive got a feeling
By your look youre through
Oh no
What youre revealing
I sit and pray
"And I will pull through, oh no yeah When you let go"
Of all youve known
The butterflies fly
And you will see the rainbows
And all the love
Everything will be shown
So let go
Let go The touch of grass
The air
The sun it will rise
You will see so clear
It will bring tears to your eyes
Maybe everything will be alright
So let go
You gotta let go Ive got a feeling
Right now
You feel it too
"Oh, oh"
This little song
Might be the one
That will tell us what to do
"Oh, oh, ooh, ooh These tears are overflowing"
And never knowing why
All these years weve been
Weve been hurting
We have to look inside
And try
To let go You gotta let go
"To love, you gotta let go"
If you really wanna love
"You gotta let go French fingertips,"
Red lips
Bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss
Can't wait for my sugar rush Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feeling's so strong
"I'm putting you on tonight Alright, let's go! Baby take a seat"
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
"Fantasy, courtesy of me"
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Heels 6 inch
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip
Look but don't touch
Unless you want to lose your innocence Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feelings so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
"Fantasy, courtesy of me"
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
"Fantasy, courtesy of me"
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Breathe you out
Breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
"(From under, from under, from under, from under) So let me go"
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
"(From under, from under, from under, from under) And part of me still believes"
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
"(From under, from under, from under, from under) I don't wanna dream about"
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
"(From under, from under, from under, from under) From under, from under, from under, from under. I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream"
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
"Into the unknown, I will be bold"
I'm going to places I can be out of control And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly I love myself
It's not a sin
I can't control what's happenin' 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand There's a world undefined
And my body is mine
I won't be left behind
I'm already here 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand Do you feel this
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why don't you just move along? I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'? Now you're all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rocks on what's real

But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
I can roll if you can
Don't be a punk punk What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere

"Se está haciendo difícil esperar,"
"Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,"
Que ella no sabe realmente
"Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,"
"Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano"
Así que ...
"Yo no quiero ser,"
El único que sabe
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
"Dicen que el amor por mí,"
"Estoy de pie temblando de tierra,"
"Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo:"
"Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
"Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
"Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,"
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo?
"Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,"
Pero es que lo que
Siente esto debe ser.
Mi amor es como bala
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
"No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,"
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
"Hasta que me aviso,"
Necesito saber en este momento
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
"Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
"Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
"Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,"
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
"Pero chica que me pone nervioso,"
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
¿Y qué va a tomar
Para la celestial ...
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
"Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
"Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
"Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,"
"Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Hey, hey, hey"

When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
"But she's dancing with another man My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways"
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

To try and apologize for my mistakes

Give you all his hours

Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much
You loved to dance

In hopes you're on
The other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon Oh I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know 'Cause when the sun goes down
someone's talking back
Yeah they're talking back At night when the stars
Light up my room

'Cause everything you heard is true You poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone

Ooh! I've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
all around me i can feel a change (ohh) CHORUS
"I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me"
"leave the past behind me, today my life begins"
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
"I know I can make it, today my life begins Yesterday has come and gone"
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
"all around me i can feel a change (ohh) I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me"
"leave the past behind me, today my life begins"
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
"I know I can make it, today my life begins Life's too short to have regrets"
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
only have one life to live
"So you better make the best of it I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me"
"Leave the past behind me, today my life begins"
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
"I know I can make it, today my life begins I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me"
"Leave the past behind me, today my life begins"
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
"I know I can make it, today my life begins"
Today my life begins... Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
"Oh, how could I be so lucky"
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin' through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
"I see myself I'm looking at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again"
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
"So why are we here talkin' to each other again Uh, I see the truth in your lies"
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
"I see you Wayne, I'm lookin' at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again"
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Lookin' at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fuckin' dad
"Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors"
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma smile that's a blessin'
"I see the change, I see the message"
And no message could been any clearer
"So I'm starting with the man in the Mirror on the wall, (MJ taught me that)"
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (take them to mars man)
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
"Uh Mirror on the wall, here we are again"
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Mirror on the wall
"Hey BP, looks like I did take 'em to mars this time So why are we talkin' to each other again Man, look at you, been walking in here looking all pretty and angry and mean and good"
Haha
Now I know you didn't get your hair done so you could just sit down and just sit still
"Hey, we tryna have a good time tonight, let's go over here (let's go over here!) It's my birthday"
"(No, it's not)"
But I still look good though
(High comb hot)
I bet you want an autograph
For you and your friends
Gotta do it in the penthouse
"That's where I keep my pen What you can't dance, ain't got rhythm?"
What you got a man? I don't see you with him
"Put your phone down, let's get it"

It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
"It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me"
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
"Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong!"
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend

Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
"It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? Oh, oh I, I was a city boy"
Riding to danger's where I'd always run above and is hurt
I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
"If I knew one day you would come Now, baby, now, baby, now, baby"
"Oh, oh, oh, I, I know it breaks your heart"
To picture the only one you wanna love
"In someone else's arms, but I wouldn't have done All the things that I have done"
"If I knew one day you would come Now, baby, now, baby, now, baby"
"Oh, baby, please, let's leave the past behind us So that we can go where love will find us"
"Yeah, will find us I know once girls would leave me"
"But I know that you believe me Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen"
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
"No, I wouldn't have done"
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you would come

Every day's a new day in love with you
With each day comes a new way of loving you
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wonder
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you Oh I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
Oh I love you more today than yesterday

"Every time's a new way, every time I love ya..."
Every time I love ya... How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
"So stubborn, thinking I know what is right"
"But life proves me wrong every time Taking roads that lead me no where,"
How do I expect to get there
But when will I learn to just put you first I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
"But I was wrong, cause only with you"
"Can I move on (can I move on) When I'm weak, it's you that makes me strong"
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I forget to close my eyes
And listen to my heart
"With you, life is so easy"
"Why do I make it hard Oh, taking roads that lead me no where,"
How do I expect to get there
"When will I learn to just put you first I, I come to you now when I need you"
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
"But I was wrong, cause only with you"
"Can I move on I'll get out of my own way,"

"I'll be ok tomorrow. Me and my guitar tonight,"
"Singing to the city lights,"
Tryna live on more than what I got.
"'Cause '68 cents ain't gonna pay the rent,"
"So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops. 'Cause my job got me going nowhere,"
So I ain't got a thing to lose.
"Take me to a place where I don't care,"
"This is me and my liquor store blues. I'll take one shot for my pain,"
One drag for my sorrow.
"Get messed up today,"
I'll be ok tomorrow.
"One shot for my pain,"
One drag for my sorrow.
"Get messed up today,"
"I'll be ok tomorrow. Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like Superman"
"And thinking that I run the whole block,"
I don't know if it's just because pineapple kush between my jaws
"Has got me feeling like I'm on top Give me this one shot for my pain,"
One drag for my sorrow.
"Get messed up today,"
I'll be ok tomorrow.
"One shot for my pain,"
One drag for my sorrow.
"Get messed up today,"
I'll be ok tomorrow. Now greetings to the world! You best believe! Oh (oh) Oh (oh) Ohhhh

Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
"I hope you come home soon, soon"
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
"I hope you come home soon, soon"
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh See you down there everyday
Trying to find a different way
To build some kind of ladder to the sky Trying to find some way to see
"Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once"
And you don't know why Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart
See you when you cry yourself to sleep
It's tearing me apart I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
"Someday you'll understand,"
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
"Yes I'm madly in love with you I know that you're waiting for,"
A chance to come in from the war
"If only a moment, if only a day A place where you feel safe and warm"
A sanctuary from the storm
Until all of these questions fade away But I cannot count on all the signs
You've passed away as mere coincidence
And I'm running out of ways to break through
"Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean"
I'll never give up on you I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
"Someday you'll understand,"
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
"You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one"
"If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'"
All the eesha's waitin' on me
"So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'"
If this is how it's gonna be? I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
"Oh, look what you making me do Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby"
"Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?"
"Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games"
"I don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'"
All the eesha's waitin' on me
"So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'"
If this is how it's gonna be? I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
"Oh, look what you making me do Pick up the phone, pick up the phone"
'Cause all this loving needs a home
"Oh no, look at what you started, baby"
"Now I'm left here brokenhearted, baby"
There's a pain in my chest I cannot explain
"I told myself I wasn't gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry, no no)"
"Then somebody's gotta come dry these eyes (dry these eyes) ""Hi, you've reached Halle Berry"
"Sorry, I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number"
"I'll get right back to you"" Damn, damn, damn I'm calling, calling, calling, calling all my lovelies"
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
"Oh, since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me, baby)"
"Look what you making me do Pick up the phone, pick up the phone"
"'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh Ooh, don't we look good together?"
There's a reason why they watch all night long
"Yeah, know we'll turn heads forever"
So tonight I'm gonna show you off When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
"Baby, that's what you do"
"No, my baby, don't play"

Nothing can stop us tonight When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
"Baby, that's what you do"
"No, my baby, don't play"
Blame it on my confidence

"You know it, you know it Fellas grab your ladies if your lady fine"
"Tell her she the one, she the one for life"
Ladies grab your fellas and let's do this right
"If you're on one like me in mind Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on"

"You know it, you know it We've been hanging out all night"
Everything's been so nice
Wish I didn't have to go
Feeling sexy in your bedly
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
[ Lyrics from:
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Something about you makes me wanna drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait when till the next time I see you (uh) home home Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Your telling me aint no rush to stay there's no delay oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh... Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
ah babe ah baby just take me the long way home Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind
"'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright"
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her door
"'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money"
And she did it for fun
"Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny"
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
"You'll be begging me, please please please"
"And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh"
"While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night"
I spend my lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in trying
"Once I get my hands on you, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money"
And she did it for fun
"Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny"
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run I should've known better (I should've known better)
'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever (She never said forever)
"I'm a fool that played her game Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money"
And she did it for fun
"Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny"
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
While I hide from the sun It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like
"Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side"
"And you, all you gotta do is cross the line"
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
"You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,"
Waiting on the other side We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like
"Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side"
"And you, all you gotta do is cross the line"
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
"You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,"
Waiting on the other side If they say life's a dream
Call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland
It damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line
You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line and come back alive
"But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side"
"And you, all you gotta do is cross the line"
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
"You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,"
Waiting on the other side It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
"It's better if you don't understand We are young, we run free"
"Stay up late, we don't sleep"
"Got our friends, got the night"
We'll be alright Tonight you won't be by your self-self

You know you look even better than the way you did now before
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful
"It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals"
"Oh, let's go"
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
"This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me"
Lift off and say goodbye
"Just let your fire set me free Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight"
Take us to that special place
"That place we went the last time, the last time I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long"
And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you gone
"It's good to see you again, good to see you again"
"On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life"
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
"Everything is alright, everything is alright Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight"
Take us to that special place
"That place we went the last time, the last time, oh Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive"
Take us to that special place
"That place we went the last time, the last time Tu-ru-tu don't you never look back"
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
"Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs"
"Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight"
Take us to that special place
"That place we went the last time, the last time, oh Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive"
Take us to that special place
"That place we went the last time, the last time Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"Baby here we are again, ooh I can see it in your eyes, you want a good time"
You wanna put your body on mine
"Alright but don't change your mind, don't you change it, oh no Oh yeah you called me today, drove all this way"
"So don't let this bus go to waste, oh no"
"Your pleasure pleasure island is where we can go No I won't think you're easy, no I won't think you're fast"
Your eyes saying please me but your lips care to ask
No need to fight it when you know it feels right
"You say you're a woman who knows what she likes Then show me, you got to you got to show me"
You tell me all day that you're lonely
"But show me show me show me tonight, yeah"
"Girl show me, you got to you got to show me"
You tell me all day that you're lonely
"But show me show me show me tonight, yeah Love the way that you laugh, the way that you smile"

"Tell me girl what you gon' do No I won't think you're easy, no I won't think you're fast"

barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him oh oh he taught me everything I know
and till this day it shows
he was more than just a friend there was so many times I would doubt myself
but his words were always there to help i wouldn't be
where i am
if my father didn't tell me
to never say i can't
he'd carry me
and never let me fall
oh and the only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you can't oh oh
never say you can't
oh oh no
oh oh so when life's rain begins to fall
and you're out there on your own
and you can't see a thing
oh no no
just find that voice that understands
for me it was my old man
he taught me to say the words I can
oh there was so many times I would doubt myself
but his words were always there to help I wouldn't be
where I am
if my father didn't tell me
to never say I can't
he'd carry me
and never let me fall
oh and they only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you can't everything you taught me will stay with me forever
no I won't forget a thing
oh
because of my dad I now know my son better
and I hope i can do for him what he did for me I wouldn't be
where I am
if my father didn't tell me
to never say I cant

and never let me fall
oh and they only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you cant oh oh never say you can't (x2) Well looky here looky here ah what do we have?

"You'll tell me baby, baby please don't go away"

'Cause everything you heard is true You poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
"So you better run run runaway, runaway baby"
"Uh, ah yeah Well let me think, let me think, ah what should I do?"

"oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh) Look at her shinin'"
Her feathers they glow
Now the jungle's smiling
'Cause our baby's home
Can you feel what I feel?
The day has come at last
Our precious jewel has returned
I'll be the first to say welcome back
"Oh welcome back I say welcome, welcome, welcome"
"Back Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'"
"Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying"
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
"Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me"
"And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see"
"But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay? """
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
"Yeah Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me"
"Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy"
"She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change"
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
"So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say When I see your face"
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
"Just the way you are Yeah Oh, i was perfect"
For the circus
"if she dared me, i do it"
Love makes you stupid
"i gave it up, But i guess it was not enough"
Cause she never seemed satisfied
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
Oohh x2 she set the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But i still kept on reaching
she watched me try
At least a thousand times
"If she loved me, She'd stop me But noo"
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
I saw something worth my future
So wrong So wrong
In my mind i was all it took
But i guess i wasn't wrong
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
"(Oohh x2) i gotta find my way out of this hell, you got me into,"
"my baby's sleepin in anothers bed,"
"it's like i'm dreamin that walls are closing in on me,"
"i just wanna know you care. i wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay,baby,"

It's getting hard to breathe
"I'm trying to make her see,"
That she don't really know
"That I'm trying to find a way,"
"And tell her every day, that she just goes along"
So I...
"I don't wanna be,"
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
"I'm standing shaking ground,"
"And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it, Chorus:"
"Cause I'm losing my head,"
"I'm losing my mind,"
I'm losing control of myself this time.
"She's got me losing my head,"
"I'm losing my mind,"
"I'm losing my way,"
"But I think she feels I'm already lost. I'm already lost. I wish that I could see,"
What is making you
Feel that you should be concerned.
My love is like a gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it all away.
"I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,"
It's gotta be with you and no one else.
"Do you notice me,"
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it Chorus:
"Cause I'm losing my head,"
"I'm losing my mind,"
I'm losing control of myself this time.
"She's got me losing my head,"
"I'm losing my mind,"
"I'm losing my way,"
But I think she feels I'm already lost. Maybe I'm trying too hard
"But girl you make me nervous,"
By now you should have noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly because your
drawing chains and
driving me insane! Chorus:
"Girl,I'm losing my head,"
"I'm losing my mind,"
I'm losing control of myself this time.
"She's got me losing my head,"
"I'm losing my mind,"
"I'm losing my way,"
But I think she feels I'm already lost. Hands over my head thinking
What else could go wrong
Would've stayed in bed
How could a day be so long? Never believe that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt so believe That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you I missed the first train stood out
In the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train
And there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for Never believed that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt So believe that for you
"I'd do it all over again, do it all over again"
All I went through led me to you
"So I'd do it all over again Oh, who ever thought a day gone"
So wrong could turn out so lovely
"Yeah, I'm so glad I found you"
Even though the day went so wrong
"I wouldn't change a thing Yeah, yeah, I'ma do it"
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
"So I'd do it all over again Do it all over again, I'd do it all over again"
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
"Oh, how could I be so lucky"
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
"A heart that can't feel, it's broken"
"His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows"
"His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows You've been livin this way so long"
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
"A heart that can't feel, it's broken"
"His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows"
"His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows All she knows is the pain"
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
"A heart that can't feel, it's broken"
"His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows"
"His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows Chorus:"

"It seems like every other night you pick a fight, fight."
"And I know I do the same, be callin' you out your name,"
"This is not what lovers are suppose to do. You tell me to go, I start walkin out,"
We both know what we're all about.
"We fuss, fight, and scream,"
"And it's all because of love,"
but you know we ain't ever giving up. Everytime I try to leave
Somethin's tells me turn around
'Cause how could I ever leave
The only one that holds me down
'Cause I know we can work it out
"Talk it out, stick it out oohh"
Everytime I try to leave
Find that we can figure it out
"That's why I always turn around Baby, before you say, say,"
"Something you know you'll take back later on today, day."
"Sometimes you drive me crazy, but I love ya, baby"
"All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me, ooohh. You tell me to go, I start walkin out,"
We both know what we're all about.
"We fuss, fight, and scream,"
"And it's all because of love,"

Everytime I try to leave
Find that we can figure it out

"Why do you do this to me all the time? After all the things you put me through, still I come right back"
"But now I know the truth, I can finally see"
You only want me when you're lonely
"If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me"
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
"Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely"
"Only when you're lonely, lonely"
Only when you're lonely
"Only when you're lonely, lonely"
Only when you're lonely Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
"Cause I loved you, loved you, loved you"
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl with no one to turn you
"Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer"
"So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything After all the things you put me through, ooh still I come right back"
"But now I know the truth, I can finally see"
You only want me when you're lonely
"If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me"
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
"Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely Oh, nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it"
You just think of yourself and never me at all
"If you're with your friends, you just string me along"
"But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on Cause I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely"
"If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me"
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
"Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely"
"Only when you're lonely, lonely"
Only when you're lonely
"Only when you're lonely, lonely"
"Only when you're lonely I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely"
"If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me"
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it

"que puedo cantar para pasar el tiempo... Let's take our time tonight, girl"
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now! So baby let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress

She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
"Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me"
"And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see"
"But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay? """
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing

"Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy"
"She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change"
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same

"Se está haciendo difícil esperar,"
"Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,"
Que ella no sabe realmente
"Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,"
"Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano"
Así que ...
"Yo no quiero ser,"
El único que sabe
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
"Dicen que el amor por mí,"
"Estoy de pie temblando de tierra,"
"Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo:"
"Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
"Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
"Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,"
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo?
"Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,"
Pero es que lo que
Siente esto debe ser.
Mi amor es como bala
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
"No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,"
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
"Hasta que me aviso,"
Necesito saber en este momento
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
"Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
"Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
"Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,"
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
"Pero chica que me pone nervioso,"
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
¿Y qué va a tomar
Para la celestial ...
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
"Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
"Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,"
"Estoy perdiendo mi mente,"
"Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,"
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. [Verse 1:]
"I know girl, when you look at me"
You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
"Oh, I want you to know I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while"
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
"Oh, I can't wait no more Oooh [Chorus:]"
"Girl, to tell you the truth"
It's always been you
I'm all about you
"Oh, girl"
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you [Verse 2:]
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose [Chorus:]
"Oh, girl, to tell you the truth"
It's always been you
I'm all about you
"Oh, girl"
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you [Bridge:]
Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you'll see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
"Oh, and now you know"
And now you know [Chorus:]
"Girl, to tell you the truth"
It's always been you
I'm all about you
"Oh, girl"
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Unless the said party is a rare breed
"The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me"
"At this point now, rap is only therapy"
"President Push, I'm more Eric B"
"I ain't no joke, check out my melody"
"Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me"
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
"Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era"
"The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha"
"Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in"
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
"When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?"
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
"We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin"
I could spend a year reminiscing
"The length of your career, reminiscing"
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
"When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase"
"Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste"
"Therefore, it's no comparison"
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
"I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative"
Clear your sinus like Claritin
"Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?"
"'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see"
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
"Me, I'm just weighing my residuals"
From where success is the bare minimal
"You a rapper, I'm a criminal"
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
"Lord, bless those praying for my downfall"
"If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all"
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
"Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee"
Bet it all or bet it large
"Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards"
I just laughed and I shrug at it

"Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I'm burning purple flowers"
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
"Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air"
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
"Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill"
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
"Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully"
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
"Baby, I could take it there"
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
"So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)"
And it's double M G until I get the chair All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

What that mean?
I'mma go
"DJ Khaled Straight up, late nights mixed with early days"
It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates
"Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break"
"These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)"
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
"The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats"
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
"Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in"

"(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key) And I'mma celebrate it for a long time"
"The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine"
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

"Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was"
"I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back"
"I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that"

'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA

"Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness"
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again

So what you look up to?
"Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing"
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
"Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed"
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed

"Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep"
"This the real thing, can you feel the force yet I always wonder if you ask yourself"

"Nigga!! [Chorus] Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic"
DJ Khaled! A divine leader
"Shine brighter, bonita mami meet a line sniffer"
"Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer"
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show
"Big up to Africa, Mexico"
"Hennessy, margarita, venison eater"
"So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either"
"Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty"
I'm just a phony assassin
"A lot of niggas owe me, I'mma tax 'em"
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
'Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
"Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco"
Last time I checked I was still breathin'
"My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar Season"
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin' it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
"To all my go supporters, go support us"
Like a local black-owned grocery store
'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that
We get government aid
"Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college"
"We need balance, so we can lease and own Ds in our projects"
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
"The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it My signature fade with the Bevel blade"
That's a major key
"I told her she smart and loyal, I like that"
That's a major key
"Start a label, run it, sign yourself"
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
"It's like us, we a major key Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson"
"Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe"
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies
Niggas is nursery
"Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me"
"Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly"
"So official, come get this issue, some women crazy"
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol
Y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
"Still paid, stackin', new stash"
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers
Check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
"My album done, niggas, wait and see Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic My signature fade with the Bevel blade"
That's a major key
"I told her she smart and loyal, I like that"
That's a major key
"Start a label, run it, sign yourself"
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
"It's like us, we a major key Another one"

"Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you"
"But I'm here to nurture, I wanna take you further"

Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin'

"On the real, nigga fuckin' with a real bitch"
"I ride for him, DMV"

"Got my eyes closed, like Asian persuasion"
"Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi baby"
"Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated"
"With all that pink on, bitch I'm King Kong"
"I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone"
Pop a pill and pop that pussy

And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest

"Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses no apologies Keep your circle tight"
"Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)"
DJ Khaled! Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
"Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg"
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
"You fuck with dude, he your day one"
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
"Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)"
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
"The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect"
"Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)"
"For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)"
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
"Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?"
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
"Cold world, cold world Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able"
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
"The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to"
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
"Family over everything, skills over politics"
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
"Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces"
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
"Multiple shots to the face, No chasers"
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
"This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go"
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
"You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas"
"That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas"
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
"You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more"
"He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war"
"Even had a crack spot together, the first floor"
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
"Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting"
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
"Old BM's with the kids, old snitches"
"Two sides, both wishes"
"Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches See there's a story in my life"
There's a story in my pain
"There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh"
"There's a story in me Yeah, for life"
"Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends"
"And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends"
"Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance"
"Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn"
"Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told"
"I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile"
"Knew him since a child, man this game so foul"
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
"Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight"
"Never on time, when I show up I be ready late"
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
"And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full"
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
"We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store"
"On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for"
Hah! My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
"Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)"
"Surrender to you, surrender to you"
Which I will never do 'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
"Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)"
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
"Cold world (cold), a cold cold world Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)"
"Surrender to you, surrender to you"
"Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)"
"Surrender to you, surrender to you"
Which I will never do
Oh-oh oh whoa
Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)
"There's a story in me (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, oh no no no) [Repeat: x4]"
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I could If the they hatin' on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best (Fuck nigga you can't stop this)
Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West Khaled and Pain [Chorus]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in your yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
"So I am, I will, I gots to go"
You got another way to live you gots to go on
"I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard [Kanye West]"
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ugh were do I start
First I stand around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad
Won't no body get up on it
I flow so sick
Nigga how sick
Sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as is get
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip
Fly as 57 passenges
This finna' be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it
No I ain't goin' have it [Chorus] [Kanye West]
I ain't never been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm Scooby I know I'm dumb
It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck yall niggas I'm out of here [Chorus] [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I'm goin' in
"I'm goin' in I go hard, for the hood"
"I go hard, for the streets"
I go hard for the ghetto

That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun cock it back then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
"Sadity thots, know they ain't forever"
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spent three hundred thousand or better that's on all the cars
"That Maybach park itself, nigga"
"That range rover came with steps, nigga"
Electric tables in the back I'm eating filet mignon
He been .44'ing all year I put the Rollie on

The Goyard looking like a graveyard
"Murder money, I'm in love with murder money"
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
"I got the clappers, finessers, and the trappers"
"Before the rap shit, you gotta go dap 'em"

"Real soldiers, young shooters put they heart in it"
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients
And the fed's allegations have you pacin'

"You gon' make me give up everything I worked for You gon' get this Rollie off the wrist, yeah"

You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds
"Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with"
"Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do"
I had you after twelve but you came right after at two
I could have anything I'd want but I still want you

I'm not really into the sentimentals
Just me and you behind the tinted windows
While you throwing all these innuendos

"I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch"
You deserve a young young legendary
Heartthrob speeding up your respiratory
Treat these others hoes secondary
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Faithful to you even when I'm on road
Even if I'm on a different coast
"I'mma still make you feel close, mama"
I'm addicted to your ass and titties
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City
"Got my ass throwing hundreds, fifties"
"Outta thin air, yeah thats magic tricking"

Make your mind as clear as the water you swimming in
In and out that bitch like we amphibians

"I'mma put you on the businesses, I'mma divy up the dividends"
"I'mma show you what the fuck commitment is, baby"

DJ Khaled I'm here to right my wrongs

I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
"Forgive me, father"
Those were my demons Don't even look back on it
"You ready for change, better act on it"
They look up to you so don't slack on it
"It's a blessing, you know that you're talented"
Some people don't know what their talent is
What's sad is they don't know what balance is
I ain't been the same since I had a kid
Look out for him and protect where I live
I done got famous for what I did
"Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same"
Now the bank come to where I live
"Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game"
Did it all for the fame
And don't call it a game
Started small every day
"We worked hard, and now they call us bosses And I done seen so many people slow down"
"I can't relate, I can't relate, no"
And I done seen so many people change up
"I can't relate, I can't relate, no"
"When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad"
"I can't relate, I can't relate, no"
"Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past?"
"I can't relate, I can't relate, no I'm here to right my wrongs"
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
"Forgive me, father"
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
"Forgive me, father"
"Those were my demons Major, yeah!"
"I got visions, I miss fortune all day"
"What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all"
I shake these nightmares all day
How can I give you my mind?
"When I try to think, it just race"
How can I give you my heart?
"When I call on it, it just breaks"
I put the city on top
"District, V.A. all day"

Why you make me this way? I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess of it
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
"Forgive me, father"
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
"Forgive me, father"
Those were my demons Folarin
"Major Key, special cloth I go on and on"
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
And it's cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I should made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
"And, yeah, I need it all right now"
"Last year I had drama, girl not right now"
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
"You the only one I know could fit it all in them, man I always wonder if you ask yourself"
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
"Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?"
"You know you only do that with me, right?"
"Yeah, double checkin' on you"
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
"I be out of words, tryna sum it up"
Girl you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
"Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep"
"This the real thing, can you feel the force yet I always wonder if you ask yourself"
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
"Yeah, is it just me?"
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to
(Would you fuck me for free?) Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem
It's We The Best OVO
Summers ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one
Bless up Yeah
We The Best Music
"DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me"
Unless the said party is a rare breed
"The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me"
"At this point now, rap is only therapy"
"President Push, I'm more Eric B"
"I ain't no joke, check out my melody"
"Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me"
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
"Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era"
"The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha"
"Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in"
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
"When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?"
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
"We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin"
I could spend a year reminiscing
"The length of your career, reminiscing"
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
"When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase"
"Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste"
"Therefore, it's no comparison"
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
"I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative"
Clear your sinus like Claritin
"Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?"
"'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see"
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
"Me, I'm just weighing my residuals"
From where success is the bare minimal
"You a rapper, I'm a criminal"
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
"Lord, bless those praying for my downfall"
"If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all"
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
"Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee"
Bet it all or bet it large
"Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards"
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts
Kiss DJ Khaled Wild Love I know I said Nas album done

Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger
"No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas"
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
"The speed of sound, what's your life like?"
"Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser"
"She not asking questions, seen the vests"
Seen other kids in the caskets restin'
"Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail"
"For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck"
I gave myself a good hand
Probably ran through a hundred million
"Per decade, I'm not phased"
And I could spot you a hundred million
Before you could ever spot grays
Chili Fritos in the helicopter
"Money can't get that ghetto out'cha Hundred-fifty, stack it all in my Gucci Jacket"

They take your soul out your body
They not secure
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
"Resort to violent reactions, that's childish"
My life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustle (straight up)
Niggas movin' bricks
"Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks"
Everybody hold this money in thicks
"Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?"
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep)
"43, morally ambiguous, you serious?"
"Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this"
Out of New York's biggest and richest
"I'm the template, low-key the busiest"
"The game chose me, deal with it"
"So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic"
"But silent listen, use the same letters to spell it right, so hear me"
"From Nasty, I'll match ya, here's another appetizer"

"And I thank God, I thank God that I made it"
"They surprised, they surprised that I made it"
"Heart is like diamonds, keep blindin' their faces"
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can't explain how it feels to be patient

I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
"After they use you, then they abuse you"
Then they get mad when they lose you
(Excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
"You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual"
"Anything I touch, I bless it"

"And I thank God, I thank God that I made it"
"They surprised, they surprised that I made it"

"And I thank God, I thank God that I made it"
"They surprised, they surprised that I made it"

And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need
I got my foot in the door but still hustlin' for more
Check in the game man back in the light (now I'm back in the light)
I'm fed up (ay) I'm fed up (ay) I'm fed up (ay)

And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy

With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
"And my fans who been so patient,"
Me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
"Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit"
"Hate these fucking allegations,"
"I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking, watch me take it All I care about is money and the city that I'm from"

"And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,"
"Fuck it, I'm on one"

"Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I'm burning purple flowers"
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
"Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air"
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
"Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill"
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
"Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully"
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
"Baby, I could take it there"
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
"So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)"
And it's double M G until I get the chair All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
"I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done"
"And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young"
"And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,"
"Fuck it, I'm on one"

Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it

Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now

But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one

"My money and my lady, no"
"They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down"
"They tryna tear us down, hey, hey, hey I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's tangible"
I'm touchin' M's now my life is pandemonium
"I go and re-up on you, new Aventadors"
Everything around me too colossal
You niggas old news like a fossil
Every single night I got a bad bitch
"She didn't come alone, she came with another bad one"
"I done caught a vibe and a wave, double jeopardy"
They know I'm the king of these melodies
"You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key"
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay (With foreplay)
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica (Santa Monica)
We was best friends until the fall out

"(Hey) They talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me"

"Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up"
They wanna see me on my last one (Last one)
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
"No, or see you in a Benz wagon"
With your new bag on
The bag that these hatin' bitches only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on

Straight out the holy land to holdin' grams
Tra-tra-trappin' out stolen vans with goals and plans
"Lonely man, remember bein' my only fan"
"I'm down and up, the Midas touch, the golden hand"
Blood in the soil is over oil
"Cold-hearted, my blood boils"
The spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil
"Man these arms can't reach you, AR's won't recoil"
"Goddamn, I might marry a heiress and move to Paris"
"Fuck the carriage baby, let's go disappear and just perish"
Thirty karats in the gold
I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit
My chariot is McLaren
It's all numeric
"Talkin' numbers, you incoherent"
"Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring"
"Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important"
My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning
"Final warning, final warning, final warning"
Every morning you'll awake and await mourning
We earn it then we burn it to ash
I call it urn money
My dog called 40 before he turned 20
"Money is earned, the rest is inherited"
"Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American"
"Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich"
"I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn"
"Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase"
I ain't shit but let you eat from the same plate
If you ungrateful then you ain't great
Me and Khaled come from the same place
"Huh, holy land, holy land"
Back when I was holdin' grams just to haul a Benz
"Yeah, holy land, holy land"
My father never was a holy man 
"I've been down so long, it look like up to me"

You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach

"Like one, three, yeah [Pre-Hook]"
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
"Yeah, I know they wanna take my place"

That's when they smile in my face

Skrrt [Intro: Moodymann]
"Hold on, hold on, fuck that. Fuck that shit. Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute. Fuck that shit. Still on this mothafuckin' record. I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all. Aye, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better. [Verse 1]"
"Listen, seein' you got ritualistic"
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
"'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah"
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart [Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
"I can't blame you, no, no"
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
"I can't blame you, no, no [Verse 2]"
"Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance"
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
"Leavin', you're just doin' that to get even"
"Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now"
They keep fallin' apart [Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
"I can't blame you, no, no"
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
"I can't blame you, no, no [Outro]"
Tryin' to think of the right thing to say [Hook: Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
"Don't worry, I swear"
I know you're trying to help me [Verse: Drake]
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on my road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
"Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal"
"I play my part too, like a sequel"
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
"Question is, do they believe you?"
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
"Never chase it, let it come to you"
You out here tellin' everybody everything
"You niggas move like the one-two, yeah [Hook: Jorja Smith]"
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
"Don't worry, I swear"
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
"I know, I know [Outro: Drake]"
And more chune for your headtop
"So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Intro]"
"Ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin', with like, some pimpin' to it, or something? That you can relax, pop a top to, or something? [Verse 1]"
"Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy"
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
"I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me"
"Or better yet, wait on me [Hook]"
"Nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah"
Can't just leave it off that way
"Sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah-nah"
"Can't just leave it off that way, nah [Verse 2]"
At least do I get an invitation or something
A statement or something
"Ask about that, you would say it was nothing"
But here's another nothin' that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way... [Hook]
"I've been down so long, it look like up to me"
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
"Straight up to my face, straight up to my face"
"I've been down so long, it look like up to me"
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
"Straight up to my face, straight up to my face [Verse 1]"
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
"No, you can't ""son"" me"
You won't never get to run me

Skrrt [Intro: Kyla]
Baby I like your style [Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist
"Front way, back way"
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
"Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT"
I pray to make it back in one piece
"I pray, I pray [Hook: Drake]"
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Bridge: Kyla]
Baby I like your style [Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
"Soon as you see the text, reply me"
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time [Hook: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Break: Wizkid]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
"Wine it, wine it, very long time"
"Oh yeah, very long time"
"Back up, back up, back up and wine it"
"Back up, back up and wine it, girl"
"Back up, back up, back up and wine it"
"Oh yeah, very long time"
"Back, up, back up and wine it, girl [Bridge: Kyla + Wizkid]"
Tell me
"I need to know, where do you wanna go?"
"Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow"
Make you lose control
"Where, where, where"
"Where, where, where, where"
"Oh yeah, very long time"
"Where, where, where"
"Back, up, back up and wine it, girl"
"Where, where, where, where"
Cause if you're down
"Back up, back up and"
Cause if you're down
"Back up, back up and"
Cause if you're down
"Back up, back up and [Hook: Drake]"
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
"Higher powers taking a hold on me You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to"
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
"Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out"
"Cause ever since I left the city, you"
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
"That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city, you, you, you"
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
"Ever since I left the city, you"
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
"That can only mean one thing These days, all I do is"
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
"You don't need nobody else, no"
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
"Used to always stay at home, be a good girl"
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
"Right now, you're someone else You used to call me on my cell phone"
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
"If you let me, here's what I'll do"
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
"What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed"
"I've had mine, you've had yours we both know"
"We know, they don't get you like I will"
My only wish is I die real
"Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal"
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
"So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case"
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
"I'll be there for you, I will care for you"
"I keep thanking you, just don't know"
"Trying to run from that, say you're done with that"
"On your face girl, it just don't show"
"When you're ready, just say you're ready"
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
"And the parties over, just don't forget me"
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
"You won't ever have to worry,"
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
"So look me in my eyes 'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do"
I'll take care of you
"I've loved and I've lost It's my birthday, I get high if I want to"
"Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to"
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
"One time, been in love one time"
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
"We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed"
"I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know"
"We know,"
"You hate being alone, you ain't the only one"
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say [Intro: Nai Palm]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
"And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice"
And more chune for your head tops
"So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Verse 1]"
"Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid"
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin' up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
"More life, more everything"
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit [Hook]
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye!"
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye!"
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 2]"
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden hills where I post
"Iced up, my day slow"
"Silk pajamas when I wake, though"
"Miraval to the face, though"
I drunk text J-Lo
"Old number, so it bounce back"
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows and front-door money
"Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that"
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
"Southwest, no first class"
"Hilton rooms, gotta double up"
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
"Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?"""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
"Now me and Chef, KD"
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
"I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me"""
Where you at? I never see you [Hook]
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye!"
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye!"
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 3]"
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
"It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now"
So let's just get it out the way
Lotta niggas goin' bad on me
"Please, one at a time"
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die [Hook]
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye!"
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye!"
"Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 4]"
"Hidden hills where I post, yeah"
"Ye already know, yeah"
I'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood
"Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah"
"House party up the road, yeah"
I'm not Kid 'n Play
"This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah"
"Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah"
"You get high and do the most, yeah"
How you let the kid fightin'
Ghost-writin' rumors turn you to a ghost?
"Oh, you niggas got jokes"
"Free smoke, free smoke [Outro]"
Baka
"Yeah, we outchea"
"Ya don know, aye?"
"It's a OVO ting, aye?"
"Ya don know, aye?"

More life You know a lot of girls be

This is not to get confused
"This ones for you Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted"
"We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it"
"You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it"
"I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it"
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
"She make me beg for it, till she give it up"
"And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best"

"All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night"
"She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg"
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
"Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy"
"360 with the wrist, boy"

"Yeah, I'm on some Raptors pay my bills shit"
"All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer"
"Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker"
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
"Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture"
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
"I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night"
"Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker"
That's my nigga
"Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it"
"I mean we can really get it, we can go for it"

"Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"""
"Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us"
"Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?"
"Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?"
"They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this"
"I was ready, fuck that, I've been ready"
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
"You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg"
"Damn, okay, from that perspective"
"I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that"
"'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at"
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
"Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all"
"But when they need a favor, who do they call?"
"Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved"
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
"They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on"
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
"'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'"
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
"Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?"
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
"Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'"
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
"PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'"
"Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'"
"Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game"
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
"Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up"
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
"Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense"
"Ask yourself, how do we match up now?"
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
"If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati"
This is a gated community
Please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing 'cause
I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse
But man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
"Boy, Versace, Versace"
We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
"The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy"
"I've been so quiet, I got the world like"
What the fuck is he planning?
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
'Cause that shit might come in handy
"Started a label, the album is comin'"
"September, just wait on it"
This year I'm eating your food
And my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house
"I sit back like ""damn I look great on it"""
I do not fuck with your new shit
"My nigga, don't ask for my take on it"
"Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando"
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's
"'Cause business is business, its strictly financial"
I'm always the first one to get it
Man that's how you lead by example
"Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace"
Word to New York
"'Cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me ""Papi"""

"My plug, he John Gotti"
"He give me the dozen, I know that they're mighty"
"Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets"
"She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch ""Versace"""
"Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle"
"Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace"

"Come in my room, my sheet Versace"
"When I go to sleep, I dream Versace"
"Medusa, Medusa, Medusa"
You niggas they wishin' they knew yah

"Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace"
"Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace"
"Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace King of Versace, Medusa my wifey"
"My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi"
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
"You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body"
"Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'"
"My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite"
No offset no preacher but you niggas listen
"Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons"
"Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket"
You know that I'm living
"I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh"
"Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo"
"Bricks by the boat, overload"
"I think I'm the don, but no Rocco"
"This the life that I chose,"
"Bought out the store, can't go back no more"
Versace my clothes while I'm selling them bows
"Versace took over, it took out my soul Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace"
"Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace"
"Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace"
"Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace I love you so much!"
But I hate what you've done
I know from here things will never be the same
And things will probably never change
I know what we want
Isn't exactly what god had planned
Hey its all I can do is
Hope you can see the difference
And pray for the best
Please don't forget me! I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strength Drake:
I should let you fall in love with
Someone else girl
I live in L.A
You in Chicago
You're not patient
I'm not patient
We shouldn't be together
I think we shouldn't be together
No more no (no more no)
Just think I'm where it all beginning
You're the envy of your prince
Plus you know you're not yourself anymore
The miracle of change
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
And I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry girl
(yeah)
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Try to control us
You wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
I mean women inspire me to great things
(Drake: but always end up preventing me from achieving them)
I need to grow some fucking confidence
And why you gotta say the last word
And if I tell you how I really felt
"(there probably end up being another argument candy girl,"
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)
Yeah
And that shit starts to get old
And I don't mean to say the most
But you know how they say you are who you hang with ?
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES Drake:
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear You know how they say
If you love somebody
That don't love you back
Love them anyway I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a f*** and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
"And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that"
"I just take my time with all this s***, I still believe in that"
"I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that"
"And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at"
"I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that"
"Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that"
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
"No, don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in"
And we all go through it
"Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it"

Now it's something they know
"They know, they know, they know, Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind."
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
"She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me"
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you"
That new s*** that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these n****s sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
"I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions"
You know the game even got it like that
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that

Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
"Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?"
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
"Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back"
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
"All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass"
"Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?"
Riding Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a real marine soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
"She rode it like a real marine soldier Thank you, thanks Drake, thanks baby"
Motherfuckers drunk and tired

"Oh you fancy huh? Nail done, hair done, everything big"
"Nails done, hair done, everything big"
Oh you fancy huh? You gettin' ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady rackin' up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
"And you don't do it for the man, men never notice"
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
"Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in"
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
"I love the way you put it together, ugh Oh you fancy huh?"
Oh you fancy huh?

Oh you fancy huh? Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes dicks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he just might buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
"Now here you are, with your girls having drinks at the bar"
"I say I'm buying, you declinin' I think that's kinda bizarre"
Independent with the demeanor of an R n' B singer
Naked ring finger (check)
M-3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
"Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel"
"D&G;, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe"

"And ain't nobody realer, go, go, go, go, go"
"Go, go, go,"
Showtime
"Go, go, go, go,"
"As we proceed. Uh, 5 and a half and boys"
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
"And when I find it, is when I find you"
And we can do the things we never got the time to
"Better late than never,"
But never late is better
"They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together"
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
"Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners"
The girls that got diplomas
"And enough money to loan us, a little something extra"
Should we ever need it

"Not again Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me"
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
"Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97 whoa"
Very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
"Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience"
"Yeah, and fuck, you left the boy no options"
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
"I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?"
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap I mean woah
"Can't fool the city, man, they know what's up"
"Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs"
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
"You love her, then you gotta give the world to her"
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
"Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers"
"Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga"
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
"I did another one, I did another one"
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
"Yeah, goin' back to back"
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
"Yeah, I'm goin' back to back"
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends
"Not even when you sayin', ""Drizzy, tell 'em again"""
"I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event, oh"
You need better seatin'
"I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason"
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
"Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece"
"Please, please do not let these niggas near me"
"Please, think before you come for the great one"
"Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?"
"Please, somebody stop me"
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
"Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'"
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
"Yeah, they want it back to back"
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
"I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga I'm the f***in' man, you don't get it do ya?"
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
"Go uptown, New York City b****"
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
"Clubbing hard, f***in' women ain't much to do"
"Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne"
"Still getting brain from a thang, ain't s*** changed"
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uh

"Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay"
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop

My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
"Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you"
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
"Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience"
Last night I got high as the expectations
"Last night, I came to a realization"
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
"No, I'm too good to you"

I just don't understand it I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
"Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you And last night I think I lost my patience"
Last night I got high as the expectations
"Last night, I came to a realization"
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
"No, I'm too good to you"
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
"Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it"
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
"I wanna get the late night message from you, from you"
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
"I got 2 mortgages, thirty million in total"
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
"But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yea I got enemies, got a lotta enemies"
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
"Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck"
"I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck"
"I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall"
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the wi-fi
So they can talk about they timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl she the female version of me
"I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me"
I hear everybody talkin' bout what they gonna be
"I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see"
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
"Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be"
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
"Well run up when you see me then and we gon' see I got enemies, got a lotta enemies"
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga Yeah
"Yeah Naw, fuck all of you niggas I ain't finished"
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a goal
Y'all don't wanna see Wayne win fifty awards

"I'm tryna tell ya, I got enemies, got a lotta enemies"
Every time I see 'em somethin' wrong with they memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
"So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne! Yeah, run up I got enemies, got a lotta enemies"
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
"Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga I'm off this, man This shit was all I knew"
"You and me, only"
I did it all for you
"Still, you were lonely"
We can work it out
"Uhh, But I guess things change"
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
"I'm gonna need you to say something, baby"
"Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby"
"I'm gonna need you to say something, baby"
"I'm gonna need you to say something, baby Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I've been long gone"
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
"I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see"
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
"I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed"
"If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me"
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
"It's crazy, I can't help it if you're really ashamed"
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
"Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at"
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
"You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match"
"Is it the money, want me to give it back? This shit was all I knew"
"You and me, only"
I did it all for you
"Still, you were lonely"
We can work it out
"Uhh, but I guess things change"
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
"But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby"
"Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby"
"I'm gonna need you to say something, baby"
"I'm gonna need you to say something, baby I am the topic of conversation"
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
"To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'"
"I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life"
You should have been here to kick it with me
"We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty"
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
"Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley"
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
"But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit"
"Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along"
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
"'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing? I got my eyes on you,"
You're everything that I see
"I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly"
"I can't get over you,"
You left your mark on me
"I want your high love and emotion, endlessly"
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it

"I can't get over you,"
You left your mark on me

"(Hold on) Hello, yeah I just walked in, yeah I'm good you still working?"
"Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple of clubs"
"I never went to bed, shit' wine or water"
"You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night' Cups of the Rose"
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say Fuck that nigga that you love so bad

I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
"And since you picked up I know he's not around (Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin', you could do better"
Tell me have you heard that lately?

"And I'll start hatin', only if you make me Uh, cups of the XO"

"And I'll start hatin', only if you make me I think I'm addicted to naked pictures"
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches

Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
"We threw a party, yeah we threw a party"
"Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party"
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
"Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in"
"I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?"
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
"Bet that you know them, I won't say no names"
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
"Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl"
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
"I need someone to put this weight on ""Well I'm sorry"""
"Are you drunk right now? I'm just sayin', you could do better"
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
"And I'll start hatin', only if you make me ""You're not going to come?"""
Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then Just throw up while I hold your hair back
"Her white friend said ""you niggas crazy"""
I hope no-one heard that

"Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble This is all God's doing man you can't plan it"
But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic

Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
"Tell Gelo, bring the juice"
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
"Always workin' OT,"
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got xan's in a Advil
"Bottle, I don't take them shits, but you do"
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gonna' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think

Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly prant
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. Think I'm in the house
"Don't give a damn 'bout what she think Club goin' up, on a Tuesday"
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Club goin' up
On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Club goin' up

I'm not ashamed at all

The things you do These days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
"They can't decide, they keep switching majors"
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done
Who is your replacement?
"Are we still good? Are we still good? Draped in all designer, draped in all designer"
"Draped in all designer, draped in all designer I got all exotic bitches you gon' think I'm racist"

Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
"Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug"

"This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already"
If you come here trying to take some there's a lot more where that came from
"And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing"
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
"Ya, ya up and away"
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May
We doing 300 records a day
Who really think they can get in the way
"Nah, nah, niggas is bitter they hurting"

"I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home"
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
"I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone"

'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
"Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers"
"I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker"
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either"

"But I really can't complain, everything is kosher"
"Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper"
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I probly still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
"Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on"
"If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on"

Yeah Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
"Yeah Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else"
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
"Your brother brought me through, you saw me"
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah"
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me"
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah"
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah"

Ah please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Say to you
"But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah"
Say to you
"The Mercedes coupe that you still drivin' was for me and you, girl"
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
"Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you"
And they both say that you're over and done with me
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah"
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me"
"Yeah, ah yeah, yeah, yeah"
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
"Ah yeah, yeah, yeah"
Redemption's on your mind when you
Ah please give me time
"'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women"
I tell 'em if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
"Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision"
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they proud of me
That mean a lot to me
"Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me"
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
"Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different"
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
"I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?"
Wonder if they second guessin' their decisions
"I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven"
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
"Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'"
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
"I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit"
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since 'Take Care' I've been care-taking
"But second chances, that ain't how you livin' Redemption on your mind I'll never be forgiving Yeah, I know Uh"
"Uh huh, uh huh"
Look (Drake: Verse 1)
I let the beat bang
I don't claim colors
"Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us"
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiios
(Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
"We been busy like some bees, no honeycomb"
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy (Drake chorus)
Uh
I'm tryina bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a mufuckin
Killa
Killa
Killa
Killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around
Shit'll never be the same
I'm a.
Killa
Killa
(Look)
Killa
Killa nigga
"(Listen, look) (Nipsey Hussle Verse 2)"
"Before rap,"
My last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what I'm bout
I keep my money comin' in
And never goin' out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches
I been on my grind
'Cuz on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
"Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga"
Started from the bottom now we're here
"Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga"
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
"Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own"
"Working all night, traffic on the way home"
"And my uncle calling me like ""Where ya at?"
"I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"""
"Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes"
"Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show And we started from the bottom now we're here"

"No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that"
"Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?"

Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
"All the care I would take, all the love that we made"
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
"It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia"
"I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man"
"Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man"
Don't you forget it
"The way you walk, that's me"
"The way you talk, that's me"
"The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?"
"And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me"
"And the voice in your ear, that's me"
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it

And you're wasted with your ladies

"Take a shot for me, ooh"
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
"A shot for me Okay look, I'm honest"
"Girl I can't lie, I miss you"
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
"I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you"
"But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you"
"She says I know you changed, I never see you"
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
"It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen"
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
"And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect"""
"I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer"
"Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover"
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
"And it's worse because you know that I deserve it Take a shot for me, ooh"
"Take a shot for me, ooh"
Take a shot for me

"The square root of sixty nine is eight something, right?"
"'Cause I've been tryna work it out, ow"
"Good weed, white wine, uh"
I come alive in the night time
"Okay, away we go"
Only thing we have on is the radio-oh
"Let it play, say you gotta leave"
But I know you wanna stay
You are waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
"Say my name, say my name"
"Wear it out, its getting hot, crack a window, air it out"
I can get you through a mighty long day
"Soon as I go the text you goin' right is goin' say Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Whats my name, whats my name Nor everybody,"
Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But boy you stay up on it
You got that something
That keeps me so off balance
Baby you're a challenge
Lets explore your talent Hey boy I wanna see
If you can go downtown with a girl like me
"Hey boy, I wanna be with you"
'Cause you just my type

Looking for a guy to put in work-a
"Ooh, ooh Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Whats my name, whats my name Baby you got me,"
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Then with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me yeah
"So I surrender, to every word you whisper"
"Every door you enter, I will let you in Hey boy I really wanna see"
If you can go downtown with a girl like me
"Hey boy, I really wanna be with you"
'Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work-a
"Ooh, ooh You're so amazing,"
You took the time to figure me out
"That's why you take me,"
Way past the point of turning me on
"You bout to break me,"
"I swear you got me losing my mind Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Ooh na na, what's my name Ooh na na, what's my name"
"Ooh na na, what's my name"

Downtown with a girl like me

'Cause you just my type

Looking for a guy to put in work-a

'Cause you just my type

Looking for a guy to put in work-a
"Ooh, ooh"
"Ooh, ooh What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up"
"With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love"
"You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that 'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us"
"That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us"
"So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
"Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive"
"Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance"
"I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping"
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
"I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation"
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
"I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience"
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
"When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing"
"Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas"
"We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us"
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
"You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone"
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?"
"Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us"
"That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us"
"So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
"Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures"
"Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage"
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
"A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it"
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
"Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off"
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
"Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?"
"Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't"
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
"Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision"
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?"
"Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us"
"That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us"
"So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
"Darling you, you give but you cannot take love ""Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting,"
"Scarborough ting from time, G,"
"Been have up di ting dem from time, G."
"So I don't know what's wrong with these lil waste mans out here eh,"
"Y'all need to know yourself."" How did I end up right here with you"
After all the things that I been through

With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
For the things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long long long long
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on

"That's my team, never would I let a woman come between"

"Understand girl, we fam' girl"
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
And start livin' that life dawg
Feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could
Its in our nature
"Ah, young and rich and out of control"
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
So I'm a spend another ten thousand for Dilla
Call me over-rated or created or too jaded
"Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup! How did I end up right here with you"
After all the things that I been through
Its been one of those days
You tryin' forget about

"So hard to breathe this air that we call love,"
"Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,"
"When you get hurt by the one you living for,"
"Pain can make you wanna love no more, [Chorus]"
"Loving you no more,"
"I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,"
"I love you more than I love myself,"
"(x2) Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,"
"So many lonely sleepless nights,"
"Im going through hell to convince you love me,"
"But never her approval no matter how I try,"
"The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,"
"Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes,"
"Momma always told me to respect the woman,"
"But what am I to do when her parents do not try, So many tears I cried,"
"But all for nothing Im afraid to say,"
"Oooooohhh [Chorus] Ive been so dependent on your love for so long,"
"Punishment for me is trying to let go,"
"Give it from your heart is what you taught me,"
"Addiction to pain is what it got me,"
"My life, now its changed,"
"My life aint the same as you are,"
"Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,"
"If I cant have what mean most to me, So many tears I cried,"
"But all for nothing Im afraid to say, [Chorus] [Drake]"
"Uh, trying not to over think"
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar?
"You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir"
And thats the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what Im gone do
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
"But ahhhhh, you see the same one Im missing"
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure [Chorus]
"Loving you no more,"
"I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,"
"I love you more than I love myself,"
(x2) [End] All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
"But she was no angel, and we never waited"
"I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck"
"So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it"
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
"And right after texting, told her I'm faded"
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
"Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya"
"Damn, is it the fall"
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
"There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved"
"There's stories to tell, we been through it all"
Interviews are like confessions
"Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions"
Like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
"I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?"
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?
And I say (And I say) Hell yeah
"Hell yeah, hell yeah"
Fuckin' right
"Fuckin' right, all right"
(And we say) Hell yeah
"Hell yeah, hell yeah"
Fuckin' right
"Fuckin' right, all right So much for being optimistic"
"They say love is in the air, so I"
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
"Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you"
"I flew jet, she flew commercial"
"But we still met, later that night"
"After my session, she came over"
"I was aggressive, and she was sober"
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
"And so I did, but that was last month"
"And now she's texting me, asking for closure"
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
"Shit, sometimes I wish the same"
And I wish she wasn't married
"Promises, I hope I never break 'em"
"Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but"
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
"I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?"
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you? (And I say) Hell yeah

"Aw Yeah I got my eyes on you,"
You're everything that I see
"I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly"
"I can't get over you,"
You left your mark on me
"I want your high love and emotion, endlessly"
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
"Just hold on we're going home, ho oh I got my eyes on you,"

(Hold on) [Drake - Chorus]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
"I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done"
"And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young"
And I'm only getting older somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
"Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one"
"Yeah, I said I'm on one"
"Fuck it, I'm on one"
A strong one Two white cups and I got that drink
"It could be purple, it could be pink"
Depending on how you mix that shit
"Money that we got, never get that shit Cause I'm on one"
F-ck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
"Oh yeah You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah"
"Oh yes, Oh yeah"
"Oh yes, Oh yeah You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it"
"But you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches"
"I don't, I don't trust these bitches"
They might catch me slippin'
"So you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches"
"They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different"
So your the only one Cause I don't trust these bitches
"I don't, I don't trust these bitches"
They might catch me slippin'
"So you're the only one Oh ooooh, trust issues"
"Oh ooooh, trust issues"
"Oh ooooh, trust issues"
"Oh ooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted"
"On drinkin', lets all get faded Uh Drizzy Drake, check me out"
Coming live from the the muthaf-cking north side
"Kick game, run game, run it real good"
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
"I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more"
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
"Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself"
Cause if I was what y'all created then I'd hate myself
"But still, let them girls in,"
And tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
"I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM"
"Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all That's that shit that drives me crazy"
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna f-ck like their me and I'm them
"Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you, in you Oh ooooh, trust issues"
"Oh ooooh, trust issues"
"Oh ooooh, trust issues"
"Oh oooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted"
"On drinkin', lets all get faded"
"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
ooooh ooooh trust issues When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
"It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl"
"And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting"
"And it's all because she don't want things to change So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you"
That's the wrong thing to do
"Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you"
That's the wrong thing to do
"Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you"
That's the wrong thing to do
"Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying"
And say I love you too But I need someone different
"You know it, oh ho, you know it"
"Oh ho, you know it, we both know it"
I need someone different
"You know it, oh ho, you know it"
"Oh ho, you know it, we both know it"
Something's been missing
"You know it, oh ho, she knows it"
"Oh ho, I know it, we all know it"
"I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho) We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together"
But we sure make it feel like we're together
"Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you"
That's the wrong thing to do
"Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you"
That's the wrong thing to do
"Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you"
That's the wrong thing to do
"Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying"
And say I love you too But I need someone different
"You know it, oh ho, you know it"
"Oh ho, you know it, we both know it"
I need someone different
"You know it, oh ho, you know it"
"Oh ho, you know it, we both know it"
Something's been missing
"You know it, oh ho, she knows it"
"Oh ho, I know it, we all know it"
"I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho) [Hook]"
You know you know
You know you know [Drake - Verse 1]
"Uh, you know you know how the story goes"
"You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow"
"You done seen me out, you gets no hello"
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
"I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true"
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
"The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore"
"Well I got it, I got it"
"I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it"
I try not to really think about it
I made it but im still playin' like im bein' scouted til im outted
"Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us"
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
"They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me"
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook]
[Drake - Verse 2]
"Uhh, please make your long story shorter"
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
"Damn, life is such a lovely thing"
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
"Yeah, I bet I be there I be there"
You see that '62 sittin outside? That's me there
"I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare"
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
"Damn, what happened to us?"
"Life can always change, you have to adjust"
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
"And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record"
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
"The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses"
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is
"They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me"
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
"So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook] I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you"
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
"And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose"
"Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose"
"Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose"
"And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way"
I've stopped listening to things you say
"'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah"
"Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way"
Maybe we should have just did things my way
Instead of the other way I tried with you
There's more than life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
"And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose"
"Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose"
"Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose"
"And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Dedicate, I dedicate the world"
"Yeah, oh"
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
I give you my fortune
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
"I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate"
I dedicate to you
I dedicate Throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
"You just like my psychic, I just wanna buy"
Fulfill all your desires
"Keep you in the front, never in the back"
"And never on the side, yeah You a real ass woman and I like it"
"I don't wanna fight it Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide"
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
"Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'"
Let's just keep it private
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
"I need you inspired, I need you excited"
"I don't wanna fight it I figure out you, you figure out me"
We both a different breed
"I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need"
You say it's guaranteed
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on him
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it I give you my fortune
"I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah"
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
"I dedicate, baby, dedicate"
I dedicate to you
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
This song's for you
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
I give you my all
I give you my voice
"This song's for you Yeah, yeah Dropped outta school now we dumb rich, dumb rich"
"This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit"
"All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style"
"Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it"
"Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum, they do"
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood
You boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
"All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest"
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
"Yeah, you've been on my mind lately"
"You've still got my number, girl you need to call me"
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
"Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body"
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
"They still out to get me cause they never got me They still out to get me, they don't get it"
"I can not be gotten, that's a given"
They like Pablo why are all the windows tinted in your Tahoe?
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
"Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye"
"South, south, side, that's the motto, aye"
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
"Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know"
"We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye"
"Throne is back up in it, aye"
"In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye"
"I be blacking out, I ain't backing out"
"Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I"
"I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body"
Take you to the garage and do some karate
"Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake"
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki
(Perfect) Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
"But I stay down, girl I always stay down"
"Get down, have her lay down"
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?

Automatic weapons on the flo' but who can you call
"My down bitch, one who live by the code"
"Put this music shit aside, gettin' it in on the road"
"Lotta quiet time, pink bottles of Rose"
Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold

"Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now"
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
"Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now"

"My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants"
"Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me"
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance

Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
"International Hov, that's my handle"
"My saint's Sean Don, light a candle"
El Gran Santo on the mantle
"'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too"
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess

A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
"Uh, last night was mad trill"
"I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel It's about us right now, girl, where you going?"

Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
"Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping in to your emotions"
Dry cry 'cause I'm hopeless
Choosy your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
"I need you around, I need you, oh ""That's the shit I'm talking about though, like"
You changed up
"You don't even fucking link nobody no more,"
You just dash me away like a cyattie.
"Yo, you cheesed me dog."" Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture"
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
"Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you"
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?

I used to always try and burn you CD's of my new shit
"You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl"""
"You be like ""oh word, true shit?"""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
"Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that"
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
"People form habits like that, girl"
"Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year"
"I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year, guess"
I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but I wake up on a daily basis
"I count this money up, I'm already rich"
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
"I wake up, pray every morning"
"These demons, they callin' my soul"
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control If I can give everything back to you
"All this passion I got, all I ever needed"
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
"Jealousy, envy and greed"
Too much of that shit I don't need it I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors
"Mentally, none of this shit can phase me"
"Mentally, none of this shit can phase me"
"I came out of trenches, I really made it"
"I come out the gutter, I really made it"
"I stack up the butter, I gotta save it"
"Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it"
Shoot out the car with no lovey dovey
"These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie"
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
"Take the private, it's ugly out here we gettin' it"

"I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control"
"I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
There's no need for us to rush it through
"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
"This is more than just a new lust for you Done saying, I'm done playing"
Last time was on the outro
"Stuck in the house, need to get out more"
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
"Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages"
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
"Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it"
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
"And like a potluck, you need to come with it"
"Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100"
"Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted"
"I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it"
"Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?"
"Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"""
"These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there"
"Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out"
"Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now"
"Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out"
"She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"" Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
There's no need for us to rush it through
"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
This is more than just a new lust for you Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
"No dinners, no holidays, no nothing"
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
"Look, I did not sign up for this"
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
"And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, ""Nah, fuck that shit"
"Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"""
"Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear"
"Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here"
"Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself"
"That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit"
"And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now"
"Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now"
"Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down"
"Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
There's no need for us to rush it through
"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
"This is more than just a new lust for you Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
There's no need for us to rush it through
"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
This is more than just a new lust for you All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
"Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer, much closer"
All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore Always saw you for what you could have been
Ever since you met me like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like a Bentley I
Always saw you for what you could have been
And even when its business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting out end And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine Your so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm goin' through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judged me before you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in LA I don't know whats going on I don't know whats going on
And its all becase you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
"Guess it wasn't time, yeah"
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice
You always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving tomorrow like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved you I'll always love you that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling a way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
"Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer, much closer"
All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

There's times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience

"And I'm a go hard (yea, yea) Yeah, when you get to where I'm at"
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
"I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog"
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
"Lookin' at myself like, there it is there"
"Yeah, like there it is there man, hoo"
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
"Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'"
"Watch the way I handle it, uh"
"Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit"
"She know I'm the man with it, uh"
"With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton"
I ain't playin' with it I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
"Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'"
"You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from"
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
"Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up"
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
"Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that"
"Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that"
"Wooh, dance our dance, watch me dance"
"You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced"
After this drop I got new demands
"Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then"
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
"Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone"
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
"I got, mind control over Deebo"
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man [Woman on phone]

Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
"Bet that you know them, I won't say no names"
After a while girl they all seem the same
"I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain"
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
"Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl"
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on [Drake and Woman on phone]
Well I'm sorry [Drake]
Are you drunk right now? [Woman] I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me [Drake on phone]
You're not going to come?
Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then Just throw up while I hold your hair back
"Her white friend said ""you niggas crazy"""
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
"Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble [Kendrick Lamar]"
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a canadian
That gave him an addiction
That would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rhianna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when your my type
And you win it from everything that your palm write
"Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city"
"Devil in a dress, Platinum Channel"
Live the ambiance all cause the audiance
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
Ima go 'n get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
"Capitalize That, and you weave look good"
With the indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
"Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word"
Like the rappers I know
"Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us"
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black maybach 40 pulled up G
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casualy about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn't help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
"So blame it on mr OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing on the vanity I know"
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason was the highlight was when he said
You alone to the people till you outside
"So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame"
"And bury yourself alive, then I died    "
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings"
But I'm only going to get this one chance
"Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)"
"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what"
"If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,"
"And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"
"You were just what the doctor ordered I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God"
"All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod"
"Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?"
"They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes"
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
"But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)"
"This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop"
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
"Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac"
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
"How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack"
"Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad"
It's actually disastrously bad
"For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God"
"All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod"
"Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?"
"Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got"
"Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance"
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
"Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since"
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
"Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-"
"Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position"
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
"Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?"
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy"
"You get a thumbs up, pat on the back"
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
"Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?"
"I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy"
I'mma work for everything I have
"Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy"
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
"To keep up with the same pace looking boy 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God"
"All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod"
"The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar"
"Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God"
"Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent"
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
"I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating"
But I got your mom deep throating
"I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle"
"I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil"
"It's me, my honesty's brutal"
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
"Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind"
"So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine"
Appeal with the skin color of mine
"You get too big and here they come trying to,"
"Censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP"
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
"Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
"See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've"
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
"You're like normal, fuck being normal"
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
"Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel"
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
"Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)"
"Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human"
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
"I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating"
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
"Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting"
"For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating"
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
"I make elevating music, you make elevator music"
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
"Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it"
"It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it"
"With rock, shock rap with Doc"
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
"It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you"
"How many verses I gotta murder to,"
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
"School flunkie, pill junky"
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
"Full of myself, but still hungry"
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
"And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues"
"But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you"
"I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat"
"Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
"Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me"
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
"But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then"
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
"Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God? Look"
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip? Yo
"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"
"There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti"
"He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready"
"To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'"
"What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud"
"He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out"
"He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now"
"The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!"
"Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity"
"Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked"
"He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No"
"He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes"
"It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke"
"He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its"
"Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody"
"He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping"
This world is mine for the taking
"Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order"
"A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem"
"It only grows harder, only grows hotter"
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
"Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter"
"Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father"
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
"His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product"
"They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada"
"So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on"
"Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage"
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
"I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed"
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
"Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers"
"And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer"
This is my life and these times are so hard
"And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus"
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
"For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not"
"Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got"
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
"Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not"
"Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot"
So here I go is my shot
"Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man [Chorus - Rihanna]"
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) [Eminem - Verse 1]"
"I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek"
"Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey"
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
"Been wanting my cake, And eat it too"
And wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep and it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
"Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam"
Hit the lottery (oh wee)
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
"I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep"
Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm... [Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh
"Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 2]
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
"(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)"
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
"Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking"
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying
"Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the... [Chorus]"
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh
"Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 3]
"Call me crazy, but I had this vision"
"One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian"
"But, until then,"
drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at
"Emcees, blood get spilled and I"
"Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track"
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped the feeling
and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great
"It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back"
"In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that"
Straw in the gold chump I will spend
Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
"Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts"
"I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that"
"It's nothing, I'm still friends with the... [Bridge]"
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy I'm friends with the monster"
That's under my bed
(Get along with)
Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryna)
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)"
"To take a stand, it's been a ride"
"Everybody, I guess I had to"
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
"I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans"
"It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me"
"I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly"
"And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony"
"No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he"
"From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'"
"Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him"
"Whichever comes first, for better or worse"
"He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas"
"His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt"
And fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
"We'll walk this road together, through the storm"
"Whatever weather, cold or warm"
"Just letting you know that, you're not alone"
"Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap"
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
"You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings"
"Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans"
"I'll never let you down again, I'm back"
I promise to never go back on that promise
"In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
"Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now"
"All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around"
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
"Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud"
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
"We'll walk this road together, through the storm"
"Whatever weather, cold or warm"
"Just letting you know that, you're not alone"
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
"I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons"
"I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground"
"I've had enough, now I'm so fed up"
"Time to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me"
"Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally"
"For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through"
"And don't realize what you did, believe me you"
"I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger"
"I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of"
"My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead"
"No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on"
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
"So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it"
"You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel"
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
"I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)"
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
"We'll walk this road together, through the storm"
"Whatever weather, cold or warm"
"Just letting you know that, you're not alone"
"Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings"
But I'm only going to get this one chance
"Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)"
"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what"

"Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind"
"So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine"
Appeal with the skin color of mine
"You get too big and here they come trying to,"
"Censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP"
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
"Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
"See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've"
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
"You're like normal, fuck being normal"
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
"Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel"
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
"Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)"
"Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human"
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
"I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating"
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
"Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting"
"For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating"
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
"I make elevating music, you make elevator music"
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
"Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it"
"It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it"
"With rock, shock rap with Doc"
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
"It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you"
"How many verses I gotta murder to,"
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
"School flunkie, pill junky"
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
"Full of myself, but still hungry"
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
"And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues"
"But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you"
"I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat"
"Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
"Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me"
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
"But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then"
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
"Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God? Look"
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip? Yo
"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"
"There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti"
"He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready"
"To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'"
"What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud"
"He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out"
"He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now"
"The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!"
"Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity"
"Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked"
"He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No"
"He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes"
"It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke"
"He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its"
"Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody"
"He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping"
This world is mine for the taking
"Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order"
"A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem"
"It only grows harder, only grows hotter"
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
"Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter"
"Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father"
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
"His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product"
"They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada"
"So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on"
"Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage"
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
"I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed"
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
"Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers"
"And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer"
This is my life and these times are so hard
"And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus"
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
"For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not"
"Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got"
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
"Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not"
"Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot"
So here I go is my shot
"Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man [Chorus - Rihanna]"
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) [Eminem - Verse 1]"
"I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek"
"Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey"
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
"Been wanting my cake, And eat it too"
And wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep and it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
"Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam"
Hit the lottery (oh wee)
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
"I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep"
Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm... [Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh
"Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 2]
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
"(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)"
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
"Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking"
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying
"Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the... [Chorus]"
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh
"Well, that's nothing"
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 3]
"Call me crazy, but I had this vision"
"One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian"
"But, until then,"
drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at
"Emcees, blood get spilled and I"
"Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track"
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped the feeling
and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great
"It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back"
"In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that"
Straw in the gold chump I will spend
Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
"Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts"
"I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that"
"It's nothing, I'm still friends with the... [Bridge]"
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy I'm friends with the monster"
That's under my bed
(Get along with)
Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryna)
You're trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
"Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)"
"To take a stand, it's been a ride"
"Everybody, I guess I had to"
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
"I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans"
"It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me"
"I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly"
"And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony"
"No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he"
"From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'"
"Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him"
"Whichever comes first, for better or worse"
"He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas"
"His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt"
And fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
"We'll walk this road together, through the storm"
"Whatever weather, cold or warm"
"Just letting you know that, you're not alone"
"Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap"
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
"You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings"
"Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans"
"I'll never let you down again, I'm back"
I promise to never go back on that promise
"In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
"Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now"
"All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around"
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
"Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud"
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
"We'll walk this road together, through the storm"
"Whatever weather, cold or warm"
"Just letting you know that, you're not alone"
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
"I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons"
"I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground"
"I've had enough, now I'm so fed up"
"Time to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me"
"Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally"
"For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through"
"And don't realize what you did, believe me you"
"I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger"
"I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of"
"My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead"
"No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on"
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
"So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it"
"You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel"
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
"I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)"
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
"We'll walk this road together, through the storm"
"Whatever weather, cold or warm"
"Just letting you know that, you're not alone"
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
"But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts"
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
"But that's alright, because I love the way you lie"
I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
"And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe"
"I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight"
"As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight"
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
"She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,"
"And I love it, wait"
"Where you going, I'm leaving you"
"No you ain't, come back"
"We're running right back, here we go again"
"It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great"
"I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane"
"But when it's bad, it's awful"
"I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude"
"I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her"
"I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn"
"But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts"
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
"But that's alright, because I love the way you lie"
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much
"You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet"
"And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,"
"Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em"
"Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em"
"You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,"
"Now you're in each others face,"
"Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em"
"You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,"
"Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em"
"It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both"
"So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,"
"Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday"
"Yesterday is over, it's a different day"
"Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her"
Next time you'll show restraint
"You don't get another chance,"
"Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again"
"Now you get to watch her leave,"
"Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn"
"But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts"
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
"But that's alright, because I love the way you lie"
I love the way you lie
"I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things"
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
"Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is"
"You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded"
"Baby please come back, it wasn't you,"
"Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems"
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
"All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now"
"Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk"
"Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,"
"Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball"
"Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall"
"Next time, there will be no next time"
I apologize even though I know it's lies
"I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar"
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
"But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts"
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
"But that's alright, because I love the way you lie"
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie [Bruno Mars]
"This one's for you and me, living out our dreams"
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters [Eminem]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
"If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,"
"Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh"
"Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king..."
"This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,"
"Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me"
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
"There is or there ever will be, disagree?"
"Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up"
The only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses.
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
"Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit"
"Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite"
"You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks"
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
"Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered"
"Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing"
"Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz"
"Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it"
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
"Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?"
"Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off"
"Little hussy ass fusses, 'cause fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it"
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9? but I feel like I'm 6'8? [Bruno Mars]
"This one's for you and me, living out our dreams"
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
"A sky full of lighters [Royce Da 5'9""]"
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
"My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it"
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
"I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back"
So it's only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
"Every hour, happy hour now"
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
"Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow"
"Classic now, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao"
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
"My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes"
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
"See me, we fly"
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
"Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag [Bruno Mars]"
You and I
Know what it's like
To be kicked down
Forced to fight
"But tonight, we're alright"
So hold up your lights
Let it shi-i-i-i-ine
"Because... This one's for you and me, living out our dreams"
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters Obie Trice
"Real name no gimmicks Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,"
"'Round the outside, 'round the outside"
"Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,"
"'Round the outside, 'round the outside Guess who's back, back again"
"Shady's back, tell a friend"
"Guess who's back, guess who's back?"
"Guess who's back, guess who's back?"
"Guess who's back, guess who's back?"
"Guess who's back? I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more"
"They want Shady, I'm chopped liver"
"Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya"
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)
You waited this long to stop debating
"'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating"
"I know you got a job, Ms. Cheney"
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
"So come on and dip, bum on your lips"
"Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits"
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
"I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you, Debbie!"" Now this looks like a job for me"
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
"I said, this looks like a job for me"
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
"Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis"
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
"'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""Bitch!"""
"A visionary, vision is scary,"
"Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves, a rebel"
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
"And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe"
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
"Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh"
"Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up"
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
"I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling"
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
"Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free"
"A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? Now this looks like a job for me"
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
"I said, this looks like a job for me"
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
"'Cause it feels so empty without me A-tiskit a-taskit,"
"I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit"
"Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked"
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
"And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie"
"You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me"
"You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,"
Nobody listens to techno
"Now let's go, just give me the signal"
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
"I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil"
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly (hey!)
And use it to get myself wealthy
"Hey, there's a concept that works"
Twenty million other white rappers emerged
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
"I said, this looks like a job for me"
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me Kids! Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
"Are you calling me, are you trying to get through"
"Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you I'm just so fuckin' depressed"
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
"I took my bruises, took my lumps"
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
"Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit"
"Or come to grips, with the fact that"
"I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet"
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
"In my own sorrow, but I know one fact"
I'll be one tough act to follow
"One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow"
"Here today, gone tomorrow"
"But you have to walk a thousand miles In my shoes, just to see"
"What it'd be like, to be me"
"I'll be you, let's trade shoes"
Just to see what I'd be like to
"Feel your pain, you feel mine"
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
"It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact"
"Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that"
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
"Follow me around, and wiping my ass"
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
"Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn"
"Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown"
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
"Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes"
"And you don't have to walk no thousand miles In my shoes, just to see"
"What it'd be like, to be me"
"I'll be you, let's trade shoes"
Just to see what I'd be like to
"Feel your pain, you feel mine"
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
"Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just"
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
"And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid"
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
"I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went"
I dreamed of being that cool kid
"Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me"
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
"In each other's shoes, at least"
What size you where? I wear tens
"Let's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see"
"What it'd be like, to be me"
"I'll be you, let's trade shoes"
Just to see what I'd be like to
"Feel your pain, you feel mine"
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so"
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Lately I've been hard to reach"
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
"Are you calling me, are you trying to get through"
"Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon"
"And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes"
"That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em"
"And be yourself man, be proud of who you are"
"Even if it sounds corny,"
"Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful Yeah"
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
"But hey,"
What daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
"I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh"
"I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry"
"Cause you're scared, I ain't there?"
Daddy's with you in your prayers
"No more crying, wipe them tears"
"Daddy's here, no more nightmares"
"We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it"
"Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?"
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
"When it spins, when it swirls"
"When it whirls, when it twirls"
Two little beautiful girls
"Lookin' puzzled, in a daze"
I know it's confusing you
"Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news"
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
"The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me"
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
"We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me"
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
"But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep"
"Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry"
Everything's gonna be alright
"Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya"
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
"It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby"
But I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
"Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job"
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
"But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me"
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
"Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit"
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
"Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing"
"Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out"
"To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now"
"Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here"
"Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here"
"I like the sound of that, yeah"
It's got a ring to it don't it?
"Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry"
Everything's gonna be alright
"Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya"
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
"It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby"
But I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
"And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha) Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess Have you ever loved someone so much"
You'd give an arm for
"Not the expression, no"
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
Daddy look what I made
Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy where's mommy?
"I can't find mommy, where is she?"""
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy"
"Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"""
"I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
"That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy"
Shady made me
"But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,"
"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,"
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
"And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,"
"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,"
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
"And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream,"
"I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing"
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'"
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time"
"But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
"Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket"
"It's got a picture, ""This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"""
"I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror"
"These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em"
"They're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right"
"And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
"It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,"
"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,"
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
"And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,"
"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,"
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
"And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat"
"The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet"
"I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out"
"They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd"
"I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'"
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad"
"And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad"
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"""
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice"
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
That's what they want
"They want you, Marshall"
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
"Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!"
"You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"""
"I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see"
"How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me"
"I turn around, find a gun on the ground"
"Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it"
"The sky darkens, my life flashes"
"The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes"
That's when I wake up
"Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'"
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
"Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,"
"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,"
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
"And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,"
"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,"
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
"And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I'm about to lose my mind"
"You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time"
"I need a doctor, call me a doctor"
"I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life I told the world one day I would pay it back"
"Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back"
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
"Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black"
"Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision"
"When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is"
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
"You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you"
"But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do"
"But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark"
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
"I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue"
"Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick"
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
"Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause I'm about to lose my mind"
"You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time"
"I need a doctor, call me a doctor"
"I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas"
"You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy"
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
"Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form"
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
"Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor"
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
"It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'"
"You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth"
"You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you"
"Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth"
"You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours"
"But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more"
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
"Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake I'm about to lose my mind"
"You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time"
"I need a doctor, call me a doctor"
"I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life"
"bring me back to life, bring me back to life,"
"I need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) It literally feels like a lifetime ago"
"But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though"
"You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes"
"Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke"
"Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left"
"They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?"
"Now that I need them, I don't see none of them"
"All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him"
"Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us"
"Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots"
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
"You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots"
"And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat"
"Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards"
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
"I'll guarantee they scream, ""Dre, don't leave us like that man!"" cause I'm about to lose my mind"
"You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time"
"I need a doctor, call me a doctor"
"I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life May I have your attention please?"
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
"Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced"
Throwing her over furniture
"It's the return of the ""Oh wait, no way, your kidding,"
"He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"""
And Dr Dre said
"Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)"
"Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him"
"Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what"
"Flippin' the you know who ""yeah, but he's so cute though"""
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
"Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,"
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
"Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,"
They got the discovery channel don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals,"
"Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes."
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
"Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
Please stand up
"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
Please stand up Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
"Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too."
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
"Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me."
But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
"Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs"
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
"Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me"
"Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,"
"But not quite me 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
Please stand up
"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
Please stand up I'm like a head trip to listen to
"'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends"
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
"I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)"
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
"Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny"
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
"And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working"
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
"Or in the parking lot circling,"
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
"So will the real Shady, please stand up"
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
"And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
Please stand up
"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
"Please stand up 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
Please stand up
"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,"
"Please stand up,"
"Please stand up Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,"
"Fuck it,"
Let's all stand up My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
It's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'"
"I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom"
"I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em"
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
"But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?"
"My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father"
"If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?"
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
"I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan"
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
"I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat"
"Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,"
"Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan"
This is Stan My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance"
"I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans"
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
"You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew"
"That's my little brother man, he's only six years old"
"We waited in the blistering cold for you,"
"For four hours and you just said, ""No."""
"That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol"
"He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do"
"I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to"
"Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back"
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
"So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on"
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
"It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me"
"See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it"
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
"But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does"
"She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man"
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
"Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I"
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
"It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?"
"I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect"
"So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it"
"I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway"
"Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka"
You dare me to drive?
"You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night"""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
"But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?"
"That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning"
"Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy"
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
"I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it"
"You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it"
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
"See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!"
"Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk"
"But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you"
"'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too"
"Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now"
"Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I"
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy"
"You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?"
"Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that"
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
"I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you"
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
"I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?"
"You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling"
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
"I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time"
"Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine"
"If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan"
"Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan"
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
"And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid"
"And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to"
"Come to think about, his name was, it was you"
Damn! Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
"Yeah, yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?"
"I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against"
"Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times"
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin' Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
"See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out"
"Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now, ain't you momma?"
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
"I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma"
I never meant to hurt you
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
"I'm cleanin' out my closet Ha, I got some skeletons in my closet"
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
"I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73"
"Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months"
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
"'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?"
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
"Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try"
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
"But I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb"
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
"'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both"
"It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show' I'm sorry momma"
I never meant to hurt you
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
"I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma"
I never meant to hurt you
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
"I'm cleanin' out my closet Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition"
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
"But put yourself in my position, just try to envision"
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
"Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome"
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
"Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?"
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
"And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful"
"But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral"
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
"Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get"
"You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit"
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
"Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be I'm sorry momma"
I never meant to hurt you
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
"I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma"
I never meant to hurt you
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
"I'm cleanin' out my closet Love, love"
"Love, love,"
"Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more"
"Young Money yeah uh Ah, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower"
"But it's ""fuck the world"", get a child out her"
"Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her"
"Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers"
"I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour"
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
"And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg"
"Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg"
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
"I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh"
Be good or be good at it
"Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic"
"Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say"
"I'm high as a bitch up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days"
"OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode"
"I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code"
"It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode"
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
"No love lost,"
No love found It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
"You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)"
That's right (It don't hurt me) I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate
"You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around (Yeah)"
(And you don't hurt me)
That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
"Don't want to see you, (No more)"
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
"No love, ha"
Bitch you get no love
No love
"No love, and I don't need you (No more)"
Get 'em I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
"See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,"
"I'm a little bit sicker than most,"
"Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the"
"Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in"
I ain't never giving in again
"Caution to the wind, complete freedom,"
"Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah"
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
"Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?"
"Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,"
"Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time"
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
"All the way to the parking lot, fellow"
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
"To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest"
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
"'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board"
"That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore"
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
"People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore"
"And you can never break my stride,"
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
"You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no"
"Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,"
"I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell"
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
"You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)"
Yeah that's right (It don't hurt me) And I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
"You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around"
(And you don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
"Don't want to see you, (No more)"
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
"No love, ha"
Bitch you get no love
No love
"No love, and I don't need you (No more)"
"Ha, bitch you get no (Love) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak"
"And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength"
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
"And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse 'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em"
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
"You're coming with me, feel it or not"
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
"You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle"
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
"You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out"
"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth."
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
"I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out"
"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth."
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
"I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;"
"It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie"
"Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me"
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
"The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out"
"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth."
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
"I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out"
"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth."
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
"What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart"
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
"My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict"
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
"A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out"
"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth."
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
"I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out"
"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth."
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
"Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I) I will not fall"
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
Look look Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World's got you gassed up
"Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4"
1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
You're pac he's pac You're pac none This guy ain't no motha fuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white I am a fuckin' bum

My boy future is an Uncle Tom

Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps

His real names' Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage This guy dont wanna battle hes shook

Fuck Cranbrooke Fuck a beat I'll go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc
Fuck a clock

"In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? You make me sick"
"Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick"
"Straight from the hip, cut to the chase"
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
"Play new games, say new names, ever since I broke up with what's her face"
"I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?"
"Kiss my dick, hit my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass"
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
"Puss blew out, poppin' shit"
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
"Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life"
"What you tryin' to be, my new wife?"
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
"Bitches they come, they go"
Saturday through Sunday Monday

'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe 'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

"Your superman, your superman Don't get me wrong"
I love these hoes
It's no secret
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends
"I'll call you again,"
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
"Not a jealous man, but females lie"
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Come be in Shady's world Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
"I'm not phased,"
"I hang around big stars all day,"
"I don't see what the big deal is anyway,"
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
"Hailie Jade I love that name,"
"Love that tattoo, what's that say?"
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe I know you want me baby

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl 'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
"Your superman, your superman 'Cause I can't be your superman"
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
"Your superman, your superman We touch I feel a rush"
We clutch
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
"It's lust its torturous,"
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
"Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over"
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
"'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is ""evol"""
"Spell it backwards I'll show ya Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone"
"It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go"
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
"Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,"
I've tried in this department but
"I ain't had no luck with this,"
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
"It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya"
You take my breathe away
"Your a supernova, and I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon"
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
"Right at you I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes"
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
"You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change"
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
"I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate"
"But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,"
"Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face"
"Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake ('Cause I'm a) I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon"
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
"Right at you So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want"
"But I love you so much it hurts,"
Never mistreated you once
"I poured my heart out to you,"
Let down my guards swear to God
"I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms"
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
"You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'"
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
"Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live"
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
"Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this And I would've done anything for you"
To show you how much I adored you
"But it's over now, It's too late to save our love"
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (who?)

For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady) Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
"Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)"
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
"My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight"
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
"And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a base-head!"" Uh-uh!"
So why's your face red? Man you wasted!
"Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else"
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
"I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch"
Who sat down too fast
"C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)"

"I smacked him in his face with an eraser,"
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
"Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up"
"Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup"
"Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship"
"While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!"""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
"This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)"

"I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)"
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
"I just drank a fifth of vodka,"
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
"I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide"
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
"I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)"
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)

"I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!"
"Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please"

"Ew ew ew ew Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity"
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo
"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"
"There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti"
"He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready"
"To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'"
"What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud"
"He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out"
"He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now"
"The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!"
"Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity"
"Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked"
"He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No"
"He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes"
"It don't matter,"
"He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke"
He's so stacked that he knows
"When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's"
"Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody"
"He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
"You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping"
This world is mine for the taking
"Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order"
"A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem"
"It only grows harder, only grows hotter"
"He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him"
"Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter"
"Lonely roads, God only knows"
"He's grown farther from home, he's no father"
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
"His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product"
They moved on to the next schmo who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
"I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on"
"Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
"You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage"
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
"I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed"
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
"'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers"
"And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life"
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
"Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus"
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
"Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot,"
"another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail"
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
"Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not"
"Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go"
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
"Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
"You better lose yourself in the music, the moment"
"You own it, you better never let it go"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man Whatever"
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen Ey yo
"I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags"
"And this bag, of this weed"
"It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this"
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
"All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it"
"The stress has been eating me, recently"
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
"I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty"
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
"In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you"
Go call you a lawyer
"File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe"
I'm tired of all you
"I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me And I am, whatever you say I am"
"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
"In the papers, the news, everyday I am"
Radio won't even play my jam
"'Cause I am, whatever you say I am"
"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
"In the papers, the news, everyday I am"
"I don't know it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered"
"With all of this nonsense it's constant, and ""oh it's his lyrical content!"""
"The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses"
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
"So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky"
"Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck"
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
"And the heroin, where were the parents at?"
And look at where it's at
"Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see"
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
"That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned And I am, whatever you say I am"
"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
"In the papers, the news, everyday I am"
Radio won't even play my jam
"'Cause I am, whatever you say I am"
"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
"In the papers, the news, everyday I am"
I don't know it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
"I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My name is"""
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
"What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what"
"When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out"
You've been driving me crazy
"I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit"
"And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit"
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
"No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am"
"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
"In the papers, the news, everyday I am"
Radio won't even play my jam
"'Cause I am, whatever you say I am"
"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
"In the papers, the news, everyday I am"
"I don't know it's just the way I am Shady, aftermath"
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
"The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up"
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
"Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted"
"Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink"
"Hit the bathroom sink, throw up"
"Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine"
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
"Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped"
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet

"Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
"Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
"Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist"
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
"Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish"
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
"Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)"
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
"Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be"
"Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?"
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
"He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind"
"I told him that you like it from behind Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
"C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
"Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
"C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
We bout' to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go ahead shake that butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
"I say everyday she be givin' it up There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor"
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
"I think I'm losing control God, come one,"
I ain't leavin' without you bitch
You're coming home with me
"And my boy,"
"And his boy,"
"And his boy,"
"And his girl Ha ha, Nate Dogg My mom loves Valium and lots of drugs"
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
"That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom, my mom,"
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
"Oho whoa-ho,"
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
"Valium was in everything, food that I ate"
The water that I drank
Fucking peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the mother fucker's been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
"It was neither,"
I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
I ain't playin' go find you a white crayon
And color a fuckin' zebra My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
"That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner"
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
"Ya little mother fucker,"
I'll make ya sit there
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
"You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it"
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in you're gonna
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
Until next Thanksgiving'
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit you want to sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
"Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit"
"And so what if he did? it's none of your dang business kid. My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom"
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom loved Valium now all I am is a party-animal
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
"My Valium, my Valium"
Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
"Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me"
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy from fucking passin it up got to me
And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fucking Aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack?"
You hungry you fucking brat?
"Look at that, it's a Xanax."
"Take it and take a nap, eat it,"
But I don't need it.
Then fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
"Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'"
"I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'"
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom [Rabbit]
Now everybody from the 313
Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
"Put your mother fucking hands uplook, look Now while he stands tough"
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
"1, 2, 3 and to the 4"
"1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4"
"4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1"
"You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none"
"This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,"
"I know everything he's bout to say against me,"
"I am white, I am a fucking bum"
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
"Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,"
"I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps"
And Wink did fuck my girl
"I'm still standin here screamin ""FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"""
Don't never try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
"You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school"
"What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?"
This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
"This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook"
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'
"He's scared to death, he's scared to look"
"at his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, I go a cappella"
"Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody"
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
"I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly"
"And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie,"
"Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. These ideas are nightmares to white parents"
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
"Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care"
"He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out"
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
"If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out"
"His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back"
"Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap"
"He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap"
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
"And broke his nose, this house is a broken home"
"There's no control, he just let's his emotions go (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years"
"(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)"
"Sing it with me, just for today,"
"Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters"
"In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum"
"Holy or unholy, only have one homie"
"Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me"
But everybody just feels like they can relate
"I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great"
"Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate"
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
"Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum"
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
"To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass"
"But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you"
"Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you"
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
"Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns"
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
"They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me"
"If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b"
"It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal"
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
"I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to"
"You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years"
"(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)"
"Sing it with me, just for today,"
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
"Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude"
"Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued"
"See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols"
"And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool"
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
"We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves"
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
"We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail"
"It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'"
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
"'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die"
"'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe"
"We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes"
"That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it"
"Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden"
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
"Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs"
"And we can (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years"
"(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)"
"Sing it with me, just for today,"
"Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years"
"(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)"
"Sing it with me, just for today,"
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away {lotto}

"i'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow(ohhhhhhhhh) Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old"
"Fed up with life and the way things are going,"
He decides to rob a liquor store
"(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)"
"But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart"
"And suddenly, his conscience comes into play"
"(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this) Alright, stop! (Huh?)"
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
"And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs"
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
"Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!"
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
"Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids? Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)"
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
"Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you"
"(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude) (It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute)"
"(Mm, I don't know!)"
(Look baby)
(Damn!)
"(Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?)"
"(Well OK) Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)"
"After meeting a young girl at a rave party,"
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
"Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)"
"Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek"
"And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink"
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
"You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)"
"Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)"
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
"(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie ""Kid"")"
"No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!"
"(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)"
"Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail"
"Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker."
"After coming home from a hard day's work,"
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.
(What the fuck!)
"(Grady!) Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'"
"Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'"
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
"Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!"
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)
"Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady"
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
"Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?"
"Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?"
"That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard"
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say? (What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah! Temper temper! Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
"Been there, done that, aw fuck it"
What am I sayin'?
"Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at? OK"
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend Now everyone report to the dance floor
"To the dance floor, to the dance floor"
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time
"Come here little kiddies, on my lap"
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
"No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys"
What else could I possibly do to make noise
"I done touched on everything, but little boys"
And that's not a stab at Micheal
"That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho"
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
"Good god, dip, do a little slide"
"Bend down, touch your toes and just glide"
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
"Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK (Fart Sound)"
Oops my C-D just skipped

"Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day"
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
"Get the top down, let my hair blow"
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body
"Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk"
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
"Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah"

Down the street screaming

"Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember"
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said save it boy
We got you on tape
"Telling an old lady to ""touch my body"""
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
"It gets real intense, no one makes a sound"
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit

I have no snare in my headphones
there you go
Yeah
"yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?"
"I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against"
"Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times"
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
"See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out"
"Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?"
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
"I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73"
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
"I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months"
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
"'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye"
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
"I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side"
"Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try"
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
"I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human"
but I'm man enough to face them today
"What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb"
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
"'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both"
"It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show"" I'm sorry momma!"
I never meant to hurt you!
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
"But put yourself in my position, just try to envision"
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
"Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome"
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
"'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach"
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
"And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful"
"But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!"
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
"Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!"
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
"You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit"
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
"Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma!"
I never meant to hurt you!
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
"I never meant to make you cry, but tonight"
I'm cleaning out my closet Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)"
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin') Let's pretend like its '98"
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
"Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain"
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)"
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Okay, let's pretend like this never happened"
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)"
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream"
"But those days are gone, they're just memories"
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone) Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
"Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation"
Pretend he just made excuses that
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
"Marshall you never gone make it,"
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
"'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it"
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that Airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)"
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
"I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Guess who? You miss me?"

"Baby, get down, get down Baby, get down, down down"
"Baby, get down, down down"
"Baby, get down, down down"
"Baby, get down, get down Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,"
"I can't wait, I'm going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah Ladies and gentlemen"
The moment you've all been waiting fo
"In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds"
"With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders"
"The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world"
"Slim Shady! So crack a bottle, let your body waddle"
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
"O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe"
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
"Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust"
It's on till the break of dawn
"And we're starting this party from dusk OK, let's go Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk"
"Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust"
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
"If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time"
"Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes"
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
"Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes So crack a bottle, let your body waddle"
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
"O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe"
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
"Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust"
It's on till the break of dawn
"And we're starting this party from dusk Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
"I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me"
"But hey, what else can I say? I love LA"
"Cause over and above all, it's just another day"
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
"I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz"
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
"The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado"
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
"Decisions, decisions"
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
"Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though So crack a bottle, let your body waddle"
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
"O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe"
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
"Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust"
It's on till the break of dawn
"And we're starting this party from dusk And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent! It's bottle after bottle"
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
"I say move a bitch move So crack a bottle, let your body waddle"
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
"O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe"
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
"Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust"
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk Now everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your mothefucking hands up
Look Look Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free worlds got you gassed up
"Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4"
"1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4"
"4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1"
"You're pac, he's pac, no pac"
", none This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,"
"I know everything he's got to say against me,"
"I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,"
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bomb who shoots
"himself in his leg with his own gun,"
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
"And Wink did fuck my girl,"
"I'm still standin here screamin ""FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"""
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through But i know something about you
"You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school"
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
"This guy's a gangster, his real name's Clarence And Clarence lives at home with both parents"
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
"This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook"
'Cause there no such thing as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
"He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, i go acapella"
"Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody"
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
"I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly"
"And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,"
"Here, tell this people something they dont know about me. Too late for the other side"
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'm a take control of this relationship
"Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit"
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
"I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed"
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
"Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess"
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
"I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left"
I'd laugh while you wept
"Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me"
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Its unfortunate but its Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
"I'm moving on forget you oh,"
"Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you"
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your as addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
I'm addicted
"To the pain, the stress, the drama"
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I'm a
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop
"I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch"
And its just Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life Too late
Caught in a change
"Twenty five to life Feels like a close, it's coming to"
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
"This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is"
"Find different ways to word the same, old song"
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
"Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg"
"Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls"
"Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft"
"And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws"
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
"I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?"
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
"And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet"
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
"Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah"
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
"What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?"
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to
Make a single sound
"Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out"
Afraid I never before
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
"Guts over fear, (The time is here)"
"Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)"
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
"(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to"
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
"This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents"
"Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?"
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
"That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit"
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
"And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part"
"Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck"""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
"So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song"
"But I'd rather make ""Not Afraid 2"" than making another mothafuckin' ""We Made You"" uh"
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
"My demise and my uprise, pray to God"
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
"But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the"
"Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium"
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
"I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song"
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
"From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk"
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was gone I was afraid to
Make a single sound
"Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out"
Afraid I never before
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
"Guts over fear, (The time is here)"
"Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)"
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
"(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop"
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
"Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips I get all the money, pussy falls like rain"
"Been gettin' laid and paid, that's why I never complain"
"If I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P"
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
"I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo"
You do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your program
"Fuckin' all your bitches, we can fuckin' give a goddamn"
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakin'
So I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm takin' I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit givin' my heart and soul
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal So fuck off
Shit With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
"Bowl filled with hash, pockets stuffed with cash"
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack I be the do wa diddy up and down you block
And the 10 Karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
"The K, the I the D R O C K, motherfucker"
"And you still don't know me So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer"
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which gets me high
"Strive for perfection, this much is true"
"We do what we say, you say what we do Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo"
And I get to much P to ever be no homo
Rock from Soho to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
"Put faith in lust, it ain't God I trust"
"I'm not Peter Pan, I don't fuck with fairies"
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
"I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast Fuck off Yeah, right in your motherfuckin' ass bitch"
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched we're on the same script
"Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock"
"Yo Slim Shady, come break these motherfuckers off Yo tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathing the wrong air"
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
"Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise Slim Shady and Brown Trucker, another bunch of mother fuckers"
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
"Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy"
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
"This is for children who break rules, people that straight fool"
And ever single teenager that hates school Fuck off My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
It's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'"
"I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom"
"I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em"
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
"But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?"
"My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father"
"If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?"
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
"I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan"
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
"I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat"
"Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,"
"Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan"
This is Stan My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance"
"I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans"
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
"You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew"
"That's my little brother man, he's only six years old"
"We waited in the blistering cold for you,"
"For four hours and you just said, ""No."""
"That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol"
"He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do"
"I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to"
"Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back"
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
"So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on"
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
"It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me"
"See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it"
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
"But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does"
"She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man"
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
"Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I"
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
"It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?"
"I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect"
"So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it"
"I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway"
"Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka"
You dare me to drive?
"You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night"""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
"But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?"
"That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning"
"Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy"
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
"I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it"
"You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it"
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
"See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!"
"Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk"
"But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you"
"'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too"
"Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now"
"Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I"
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
"It reminds me, that it's not so bad"
"It's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy"
"You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?"
"Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that"
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
"I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you"
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
"I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?"
"You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling"
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
"I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time"
"Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine"
"If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan"
"Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan"
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
"And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid"
"And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to"
"Come to think about, his name was, it was you"
Damn! Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
"Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?"
"And mom, I know he's not around"
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are
"Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on"
Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst
"Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse"
My mom probably got it the worst
"The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are"
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
"You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom"
"Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam"
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
"But, agree to disagree"
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
"Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats"
"Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both"
"We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)"
"Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings"
"Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road"
"And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load"
"Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and"
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
"And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are"
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
"But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry"
"Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause"
"Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes"
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
"And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but"
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
"And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though"
"But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo"
"All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both"
"Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours"
"But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause"
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
"But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus"
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
"If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them"
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
"Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you"
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
"As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and"
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
"So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet"
"I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead"
"The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing"
"So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar"
'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
"Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life Hi! My name is (what?)"

"My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight"
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
"And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a base-head!"" Uh-uh!"
So why's your face red? Man you wasted!
"Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else"
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
"I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch"
Who sat down too fast
"C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)"
"I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off! Hi! My name is (what?)"

Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
"I smacked him in his face with an eraser,"
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
"Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up"
"Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup"
"Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship"
"While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!"""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
"This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)"
"So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"" Hi! My name is (huh?)"

"Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!"
"I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)"
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
"I just drank a fifth of vodka,"
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
"I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide"
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
"I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)"
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)

My name is
"Slim Shady Tell me where to go, tell me what to do"
I'll be right there for you
"Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true"
I'll say it all for you I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
"That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often"
"Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad"
"So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward"
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
"And he said that I eyeballed him And if you fall, I'll get you there"
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
"Please have faith in my words 'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here"
"This is my legacy, legacy, here"
"There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see"
"This is my legacy, legacy"
"Legacy, legacy I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling"
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
"'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling"
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
"Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split"
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
"Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it"
"Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit"
But if this is all there is for me life offers
"Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense"
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
"Instead of tryina escape through my comics,"
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
"I could be iconic, and my conquest is"
"Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest This is my legacy, legacy, here"
"This is my legacy, legacy, here"
"There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see"
"This is my legacy, legacy"
"Legacy, legacy I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling"
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
"To try and draw from, and get inspired off em"
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
"Now you shut up bitch, I am talking"
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
"'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers"
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
"Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass"
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
"I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my Legacy, legacy, here"
"This is my legacy, legacy, here"
"There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see"
"This is my legacy, legacy"
"Legacy, legacy First verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on a island"
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
"Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness"
"I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form"
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
"Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on"
"And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn Y'all niggers intellect mad slow, y'all fags know"
"Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'"
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cash flow I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s
"My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys"
You still fly kites daily Catch me in my Mercedes
"Bumpin' 'Ice, Ice, Baby', screamin' Shady 'til I die"
"Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy"
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze And you only live it once
"So I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady"
"Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll"
(Damn) Let me tell you
What this pretty little dame's name is
'Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this Nicki Minaj but I wanna stick
(My penis in your anus)
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Try them trailer parks
"Crazy, I am back and I am razor-sharp, baby And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark"
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm on a rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim
Or statistic of this shit 'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casin's like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics
"So get this dick, I'ma live this I'm livin' life in the fast lane"
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
"But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now I don't really know where I'm headed"
Just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
"(Pedal to the metal) Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit"
"At war with a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs"
(C'mon)
"My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins"
"(Woo) I made a pact with the Devil that says, ""I'll let you take me"
"You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpses Jack Kevorkian"""
(C'mon)
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
"I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down My tenement, too many now"
To send my serenity powers
"Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity Now was called Eminem but he threw away the candy"
"And ate the rapper, chewed him up and spitted him out"
"Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down"
He's lookin' around this club
"And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town"
"Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck the mall"
He shuts a whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round And he came to the club tonight
With 5'9 [unverified] to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater
"He's tryna d-dr-drown Shawty, when you dance"
You got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' 'em dicks
"Like her lips I'm agitated, aggravated To the point you don't suck my dick"
Then you're gonna get decapitated
"Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head"
Then I'm have to take it And then after takin' that
"I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'"
It's gon' say 'The whole rap game passed away'
On top of the affidavit Graduated from master debater
Slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson activator
(Woo) Meanin' I'm on fire off the top
Might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
"Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater Don't it make sense"
These shell casin's is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader
"(Homie, they spent) Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes"
"What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator"
"Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later Tell ya boyfriend"
That you just struck pay dirt
You rollin' wit' a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin' I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
"But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now I don't really know where I'm headed"
Just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
(Pedal to the metal) I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
"To these blue and yellow purple pills Cool, calm, just like my mom"
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people
"And five I hit, ah, shit"
"I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch And stomped the foster kids"
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin' Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
"So bounce, bounce, c'mon, bounce, I said, c'mon, bounce"
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
"Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down We don't bullshit, better ask around"
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
"Bizarre, your mom is passing out"
"Get her ass on the couch before she passes out Fuck that, someone help Denaun"
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
"Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?"
"It gotta be acid, 'cos the X is gone Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian"
"And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb"
"Young, dumb and fulla cum"
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
"So stop acting stupid, you so high"
"That you might wake up with a guy On some new shit, I think I did too much"
This substance equals cuffs
"Red pills, blue pills and green"
"Big pills, mescaline"
(That's ill) I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
"To these blue and yellow purple pills Dirty Dozen, eighty of us"
"Shady brothers, ladies love us"
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
"Some, something, something, something"
"Something, something, something, something, I dunno Pop pills, pills I pop"
"Pop two pills, on stilts I walk"
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
"Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk I wanna, roll away like a Rollerblade"
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
"Look for coke to smoke No, oki dok"
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
"Had an accident when the Trojan broke Ah, poor baby"
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy) I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack? We can't get jobs
'Cos our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked If you like smack then I might too
"(Swift, chill)"
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue
"Speed, shrooms, down the Valium"
Even smoke weed outta vacuums

I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
"To these blue and yellow purple pills I'm at a rave, looking like a slave"
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
"Body smelt like vomit Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy"
"Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?"
"Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill"
"Drugs kill, bitch I'm for real"
"(Yeah, right) Shut your mouth, you dirty slut"
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut I take a couple uppers

To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
"To these blue and yellow purple pills Dirty Dozen, eighty of us"
"Shady brothers, ladies love us"
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
"Some, something, something, something"
"Something, something, something, something, I dunno Fuck it I can feel the heat rising"
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
"Lookin out, cause I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after"
"Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process"
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
"Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass"
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
"Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed"
"So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal"
"And hit the corner fast, the more asserted"
"Never looking back, may hit the curb"
"But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life"
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
"But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage"
"Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass"
"And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes"
"And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline"
"And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like"
"It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life"
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
"The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in"
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
"Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in"
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
"Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin' As time passes, things change everyday"
"But wounds, wounds heal"
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
"Still a little piece of you dies, you scream I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn"
"Rising, a phoenix from the flames"
With wings I will fly I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames"
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
"Find the light, find the light, find the light Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key"
"Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's"
"No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis"
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
"Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies"
"Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please"
"You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees"
Who you think brought you the oldies
"Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's"
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
"Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop"
"Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep"
"So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me"
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
"Fuck you too bitch, call the cops"
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
"Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies"
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
"Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy"
"There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say"
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
"And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me"
"With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free"
"When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me"
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
"I told 'em all, all them little gangstas"
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
"What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off"
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
"I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath"
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
"So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back"
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
"And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Step by step, heart to heart, left right left"
"We all fall down,"
"Step by step, heart to heart, left right left"
We all fall down like toy soldiers
"Bit by bit, torn apart"
"We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure"
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
"I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it"
"Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter"
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
"I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader"
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
"That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it"
"There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it"
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
"It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit"
"And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it"
"I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted"
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
"This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it"
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
"It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good"
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
"And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth"
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
"Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did"
"I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV"
"Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it"
"I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business"
"But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left"
"We all fall down, like toy soldiers"
"Bit by bit, torn apart"
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
"Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it"
"It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping"
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
"Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him"
"And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him"
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
"Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it"
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
"Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous"
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
"That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then"
"But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think"
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
"And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind"
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
"As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us"
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
"It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it"
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
"But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping"
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
"I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left"
"We all fall down, like toy soldiers"
"Bit by bit, torn apart"
"We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers Lickilty Split freestyle: Check this out, Check this out, yo"

"Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow"
"It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though"
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
"Whatever's got into me I don't mind Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills"
"Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill"
"You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel"
"Like I don't think anyone's real,"
"Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer"
"Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,"
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
"Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,"
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
"How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,"
"Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,"
"Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,"
"Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,"
"The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate"
"And which motel which lake they found her in,"
"And how they attacked the victim,"
"Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,"
"Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,"
"So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes It must be the ganja"
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
"Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way"
"Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?"
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
"Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,"
"He can give her some, she can give him some"
"Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome"
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
"Titanium brain that's full of, surprises"
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes
"Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,"
"I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything It must be the ganja"
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
"Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack"
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
"I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back"
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
"Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets"
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
"So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment"
"'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick"
"Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!"
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
"And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch"
"Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long"
"Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down"
"So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m."
"So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go"
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
"So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) shake your body Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?"
"Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced"
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
"So if love is a chess game, check mate"
"But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang"
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
"So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang"
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
"Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow"
"Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow"
"Dumb it down, I don't know how (Huh-huh) how-how"
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
"Hope so, now ho Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berserk) all night long"
"Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berserk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down"
"So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m."
"So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go"
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
"So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam"
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
"Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low"
"Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past"
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
"But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!"
"Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know"
"Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos"
"Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man"
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
"Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl"
"This is your jam, unless you got toe jam Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long"
"Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down"
"So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m."
"So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go"
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
"So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down"
"So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m."
"So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go"
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
"So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?"
I owe you for this one I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
"If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead"
"Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven"
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
"Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook"
"50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan"
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
"When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it"
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
"These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating"
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
"Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically"
"They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty"
"A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me"
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
"Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you"
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
"Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?"
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
"You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot"
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
"Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot"
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
"There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on"
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on

"Its fifty, they say its Fifty"
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
"Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house"
"And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth"
"Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running"
"Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake"
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
"I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper"
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
"Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey"
"I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy"
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
"Snoop said this in 94' ""We don't love them hoes"""
"I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich"
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
"Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes"
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker). I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on

When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
"If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it"
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
"We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit"
"And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it"
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over

makes no sense to play the game
there aint no way that you'll win
pretend he'd just stay outside all day
and play with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again
he wasnt socially akward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
and just lazy as shit
"fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch"
"you wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid"
you need to get your cranium checked
"you're thinking like an alien, it just aint realistic"
now pretend things just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed

left to his plane and he missed it
he's gonna have a hard time explaining to hailey and lainey
these food stamps and this weak shit

"i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Aw look at daddy's baby girl"
That's daddy baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now you're two
Baby you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you (Okay)
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
"Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?"
How could you?
Just leave me and love him out the blue
"Oh, what's a matter Kim?"
Am I too loud for you?
"Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time"
"At first, I'm like all right"
You want to throw me out? that's fine!
"But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?"
"This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!"
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at Kim
Look at your husband now! (No!)
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?)
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! you're never going to get away at this!)
You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride bitch
(No!)
Sit up front
"(Well I can't just leave 'ey alone, what if she wakes up?)"
We'll be right back
"Well I will you'll be in the trunk So long, bitch you did me so wrong"
I don't want to go on
"Living in this world without you So long, bitch you did me so wrong"
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you You really fucked me Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
"But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen"
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!
(I love you!)
Oh God my brain is racing
(I love you!)
What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
(No!)
There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
"In your living room, ha-ha"
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him didn't you?
(No!)
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
"Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me"
"Kim, Kim!"
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly don't you
(It's not that!)
No you think I'm ugly
(Baby)
"Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me"
I hate you! I hate you!
I swear to god I hate you
Oh my God I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me?
(Sorry!)
"How the fuck could you do this to me? So long, bitch you did me so wrong"
I don't want to go on
"Living in this world without you So long, bitch you did me so wrong"
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you Come on get out
(I can't I'm scared)
I said get out bitch!
"(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)"
"(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)"
"Fuck you, you did this to us"
"You did it, it's your fault"
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
Get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny wasn't it?
(Yes!)
That was funny wasn't it?
(Yes!)
"See it all makes sense, doesn't it?"
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced
(No!)
And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
"We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!"
You can't run from me Kim
"It's just us, nobody else!"
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! ha! got you!
(Ah!)
Ha! go ahead yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah somebody help!
"Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?"
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
"Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed! So long, bitch you did me so wrong"
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
"Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices"
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
"Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist"
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
"In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face"
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
"Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry"
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
"Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me"
"Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me"
"Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the"
"Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we"
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
"That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky"
"Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills"
"You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?"
"I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count"
"But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain"
"Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling"
"This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand"
"Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it"
"'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn"
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
"Oh, I love the way you lie"
Love the way you lie I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
"So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed"
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
"Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide"
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
"I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office"
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
"I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America!"
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
"I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get"
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
"I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself"
If they were brown
Shady lose
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
"Almost gave up, I was like ""Fuck it"""
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
"I'm like ""My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?"" White America!"
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
"I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get"
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
"I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids"
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
"I dont like this, no!"
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
"Shit,"
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthafuckin' spokesman now for White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
"I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get"
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
"I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America"
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
"Fuck you! Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you A lot of people ask me"
Am I afraid of death
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
"Look, I can't change the way I think"
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck Zoning off one joint
"Stop in a limo, hop in the window"
Shopping the demo with gun point
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
"Live in the muck, never giving a fuck"
"Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck"
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
"My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn"
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
"Yo, I'm still goin' do"
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
And the pants to match (Here mommer try 'em on)
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (Shittin' on rappers)
'Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
"Yo, I'm still goin' do"
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit!)
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
"Never ran with a click, I'm a posse"
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my momma lost me
"And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy"
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during a earthquake To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
"Yo, I'm still goin' do"
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
I miss my past
"But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might"
"Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write"
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
"But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life"
"Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights"
"Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like"
"Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault"
"Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl"
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
"I just can't do it, my whole manhood's"
"Just been stripped, I have just been vicked"
"So I must then get, off the bus then split"
"Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home"
"World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan"
"Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land"
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
"(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone"
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
"Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back"
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
"To the same plant, and the same pants"
"Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP"
"And get a new plan, momma's got a new man"
"Poor little baby sister, she don't understand"
"Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad"
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
"Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet"
"It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet"
"Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep"
"The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best"
"And I try, sit alone and I cry"
"Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by"
"That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God"
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
"Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye"
"Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far"
"But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know"
"And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow"
"On everything I own, I'll make it on my own"
"Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan"
"Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land"
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
"(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone"
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
"Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it"
"Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is"
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
"It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate"
"Of authenticity, you'd never even see"
"But it's everything to me, it's my credibility"
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
"But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time"
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
"But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go"
"Who must I show, to bust my flow"
"Where must I go, who must I know"
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it
"Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit"
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
"I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit"
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
"And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road"
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
"My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want"
"Is pity from no one, the city is no fun"
"There is no sun, and it's so dark"
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
"From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends"
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
"Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not"
"What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top"
"I just explode, the kettle gets so hot"
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
"But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn"
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
"I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage"
"Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words"
"Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge"
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
"I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird"
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
"Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan"
"Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land"
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
"(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone"
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road [Intro- talking]
{Eminem]
"Shady, Aftermath"
(BTOV) {nate dogg]
"aye bitch, hey! There she goes shaking that ass on the floor"
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control
"hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek [Bobby Creek]"
I'm on the patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wid Hammer
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Bobby creek is in the place
The name is snoop too
But they might been around
My drinks is 10 around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I'll let you in ya work
Come sip on my gum drops
yeah
[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
"Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop"
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
"Shake that ass for me,"
Shake that ass for me
"Come on girl, shake that ass for me,"
Shake that ass for me
"Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,"
Shake that ass for me
"Come on girl, shake that ass for me,"
Shake that ass for me [Eminem]
O' Trice! [Obie Trice]
One slug
Couldn't snuff young 'cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on his nuts
One just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
"Full breast, ready to touch"
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a blue new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
Its true that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
aint that annual annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night came to the matinee
mad as ??
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
"Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me"
"Come on girl, shake that ass for me,"
Shake that ass for me
"Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,"
Shake that ass for me
"Come on girl, shake that ass for me,"
"Shaddy I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head"
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
"We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head"
"Bust a nut, get some rest"
"The next day my mother said ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
"He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"""
Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
"Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck"
"I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you"
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
"I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"""
"Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head If you could count the skeletons in my closet"
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
"Is he nuts? No! He's insane! ""Did you get him?"" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off"
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
"Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off"
"Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot"
"Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop"
"Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong"
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
"Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off"
"Everything, except his tank top and his training bra"
"Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog"
"Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog"
"Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours"
"Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along If you could count the skeletons in my closet"
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
"Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me"
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
"Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching"
"Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping"
"Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?"
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
"Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping"
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
"What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting"
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
"No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing"
"I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see"
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
"She showed me a movie like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"""
"But it was X, and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea"""
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene If you could count the skeletons in my closet"
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Got a shit-eatin' grin
"Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again"
We're in Sin City
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
"Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends"
"I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun"
"The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack"
"And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle"
"You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again"
"Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc"
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
"I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in"
"Hit the spot, spot my next victim"
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
"Came to sip vodka, shit"
"Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies"
"I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear"
"But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)"
"What are you, pit, rott, mixed?"
"Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock"
"If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose"
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
"Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog"
"Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit"
"Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'"
"My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'"
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
"So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac"
"Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this"
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
"All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying"
"And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again"
"Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't"
"Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will"
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
"Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist"
"Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining"
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
"Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking"
But before I tie a rope around this nob
"If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until"
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
"I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny"
"Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging"
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
"It's past time, like your favorite hobby"
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
"Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?"
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
"Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis"
"chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits"
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
at least that's what her train of thought is
"Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it"
"quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers"
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
"And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits"
Now grab this Cuisinart
"And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite"
"And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch"
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
"Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?"
"I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick"
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
"Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit"
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
"Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey"
"Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy"
"I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me"
"You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy"
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
"Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car"
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
"So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride"
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
"Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski"
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
(Squee!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
"Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost"
"'Till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
"(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
"(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
"(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
"Vegas Whatever happens here, stays here"
So let's go all the way dear
"Til we get to Las Vegas Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable"
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
"We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers"
"She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then"
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
"I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors"
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
"And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh"
"I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again"
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
"Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss"
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
"Bitch, I don't give a two shits"
"Bitch, get the fuck out of my face"
"To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there"
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
"Hold up, she misunderstood me"
"I said saint, por favor"
"Thought I said to wait, had four doors"
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
"And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
"(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
"(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
"(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)"
"Vegas Whatever happens here, stays here"
So let's go all the way dear
"Til we get to Las Vegas Yo, I can't sing good"
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
"'Cause I'm happy Yeah, I'm happy"
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
"Yo, check it out Some days I sit, starin' out the window"
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
"I'm crazy, oh so crazy"
"Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?"
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
"People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me"
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
"But then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter"
"If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father"
"To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er"
"God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort"
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
"But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt"
"So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else"
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
"So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation"
"I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman"
"I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman"
"Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?"
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
"But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more"
"I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie"
"So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya"
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me Woo!
I told you I can't sing
"Oh well, I tried"
"Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?"
"Well guess what, daddy's here"
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
"And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'"
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism The devil ain't on the level same as him
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
So bad they should put his a** in prison
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
"Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em apart"
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
Illest s*** you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
With a gaping hole in it
"Whip out, whip down Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State"
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Plus it's getting darker by the day
"I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical"
"Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane"
"Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray"
I'm sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm s***tin' on the competition
In the meantime it's always mean time I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I've been a career a**hole
I don't see why these people always got my back
"I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake"
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
"Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***"
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
"That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book"
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
"But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches"
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
"You ain't fly, you're an airhead"
"I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase"
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
"Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase 'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed"
"I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down"
"No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane"
Someone help me I think my face is melting
"If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain"
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And you could see why I'd be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
"Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game 'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo"
Psycho on a cycle
If I hear Iko
I'm out of control like no
"Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost"
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
"'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it"
"Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike"
"I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro"
"And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper"
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
"I want to dig my way to hell Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty"
"Thank you, God"
S***.
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
And gay into the A.M
"And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show"
"But f*** it, suck from the tucket"
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
"So everybody, everybody"
"Circle jerk, touch my body Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back"
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? F*** you then
Blow it out your a** As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
"And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat Sometimes I feel so alone,"
"I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,"
"So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,"
"Soon as I go home and close the door,"
"Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,"
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by Sometimes I feel so alone,"
"I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,"
"So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,"
"Soon as I go home and close the door,"
"Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,"
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
"That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three"
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
"They said they found me on the bathroom floor Sometimes I feel so alone,"
"I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,"
"So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,"
"Soon as I go home and close the door,"
"Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,"
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
"And why I just don't know Yeah,"
"Ha ha, you feel that baby?"
"Yeah, I feel it too."
Damn.
"You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together"
"See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?"
"Ha ha I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,"
"I'm right back on 'em, with the"
I can't call it
"Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!"
"Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin"
"What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?"
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
"Now, it all started with my father"
"I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama"
"I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama"
"Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise"
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
"I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a"
"S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!"
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas? I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
"And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel"
"Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table"
But you may wanna find something more stable
"I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!"
"But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn"
"To appreciate me, differentiate me"
"From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's"
"Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please"
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
"Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously"
"Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!"
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
"I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?"
"Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you"
"Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you"
"I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm I'm so bad"
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
"And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!"
"Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!"
I can hold you in the morning
"But in the evening I gotta go,"
"Cause I'm on to the next girl,"
"And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I got you caught up in the rapture"
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
"But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?"
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
"You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it"
"Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'"
"Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen"
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
"So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up"
"Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up"
"Saying ""Don't Disturb"", shorty I'm so superb"
"I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words? I'm so bad"
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
"And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!"
"Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!"
I can hold you in the morning
"But in the evening I gotta go,"
"Cause I'm on to the next girl,"
"And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I'm so bad"
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga [Chorus]
One shot two shot three shot four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
"Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club"
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfuckin' gun
(Nigga what about your wife)
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfuckin' life
Oh shit the shoot is comin'
"Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin'"
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even D-J House fucked around and go shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
(Kuniva you aight)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But its real and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she yellin'
(Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late [Chorus] (Nigga I been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire is flat
"And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes"
(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit I swear)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today
I'm a park my car and walk the rest of the way
"I'm in the mood to strut, my A-K ain't even tuck"
I'm a meet you at the club we goin' fuck these hoes up [Chorus] I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People will still camp out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
"The fire marshals no, the venue's too small"
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans
And some come walk from out the parkin' lot
Get into an argument over a parkin' spot
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
"Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was"
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
"My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin"
"If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep"
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth [Chorus] It's Friday night came to this bitch right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece [Chorus] I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady."
"I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"""
"They're all like ""Oh my God it's him"""
Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock
Please Marshall please let me suck your cock
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
"All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes"
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
"This rock star shit, it's the life for me"
And all the other guys just despise me because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
Roxanne
My band
My band You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
"You don't want my autograph, yous a liar"
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
"See I know how to rap, see it's simple but"
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
"So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map"
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
"I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up"
"Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up"
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
"I swear, I swear man These chicks don't even know the name of my band"
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
"All because I'm the lead singer of my band They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not"
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code Bitch carry your own
"Can't make it to the stage, security in my way"
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!) Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
"Fuck the media, I got some suggestions"
"Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions"
"Like who's D12, how we get started"
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
"Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)"
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
"Fuck D12, I'm outta this band"
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band The hottest boy band in the world
D12!
"I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their"
Underpants
"And the lead singer of my band, my salsa"
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
"My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa"
"My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa"
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
"And take off their underpants, my salsa"
(Where'd everybody go?) This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
"This is the winner takes it all so take it all Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared"
"I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there"
"From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends"
"It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym"
"Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again"
"With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?"
"It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough"
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
"When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it"
"Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie"
"Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff"
"Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos"
"I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt! This is survival of the fittest"
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
"And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough"
"To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?"
"They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath"
"I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust"
"Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,"
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
"What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck"
"To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it"
"Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up"
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
"And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook"
"Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself"
"With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!"
"'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut"
"I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut"
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
"Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait"
"Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting"
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of what? This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
"So take it all So get your ideas, stack your ammo"
"But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle"
"This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit"
"Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this"
"Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick"
"I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit"
"Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth"
"It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit"
"But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do"
"'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!"
"So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades"
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
"It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs"
"But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve"
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
"I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve! This is survival of the fittest"
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So it take it all Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Was because you denied seeing me
"Now I'm pissed off Sit back, homie, relax"
In fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts
"Yeah Dre, sick track Perfect way to get back"
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat
That's on Nick's back I'm obsessed now
"Oh gee, is that supposed to be me"
In the video with the goatee?
"Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out"
"Bitch, shut the fuck up before I put all them phone calls out You made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick"
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out You probably think cuz it's been so long
If i had something on you I woulda did it by now
"Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session"
Down and sending it to mastering to make it loud Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do
"Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?"
However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too
"Faggot, you think I'm scared of you? You gonna ruin my career, you better get one"
"Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some slut, bitch-cunt"
That made me put up with her psycho-ass over 6 months
"And only spread her legs to let me hit once Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?"
Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
"Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, punk?"
In the second week we were dry humping
"That's gotta count for something Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about"
"How I nutted early, 'cause I ejaculated prematurely"
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
"And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling? Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassing me"
"I'm embarrassing you, and don't you dare say it isn't true"
"As long as the song's getting airplay, I'm dissing you"
"I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32"
"This is 34 bars, we ain't even a third of the way through"
"Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?"
"Oh, did I say ""whore"", Nick? I meant a liar too Like I've been goin' off on you all this time for no reason"
Girl you out ya alcholic mind
"Check ya wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine"
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
"I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs"
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
"I ain't saying this shit again, ho, you know what it is It's a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot"
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
"When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot Slim Shady, Slim Shady, I love you"
I love you too
"Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo"
Now what you say?
It's nothing
"Yeah, so what I'll do"
"Is refresh your memory when you said, ""I want you"" Now should I keep going, or should we call truce?"
"You think you cute, right?"
You bet your sweet ass I do
"I'm Mary Poppins, B"
"And I'm Superman, mmm"
"Mary P., Slim Shady"
Comin' at you So if you'll still be my baby girl
Then I'll still be your superhero
"Oh my, Em"
"Yeah, I'm right here"
You like this
"Nope, not anymore dear It cuts like a knife when I tell you get a life"
But I'm movin' on with mine
"Nick, is that your wife?"
"Well tell her to shut her mouth, then I'll leave her alone"
"If she don't stick to the script, then I'mma just keep goin'"
"Damn I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying, ""Cut the tape, cut the tape"""
"Knife! Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it"
"You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it"
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
"Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it"
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
"No favors, no favors"
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
"And what I need from 'em? No favors I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night"
"I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice"
"I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice"
"I'm about taking a risk, that might fuck up your life"
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr)
"Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?"
"I'm like ""niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too"""
Thought I had the Midas touch
And then I went platinum too
Mother fuck all your comparisons
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
So He must be hearing shit
"Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib"
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Others get the hit with the laugh
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
So you know where I came from
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
"In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt"
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
"When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel"
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
"Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies"
That's my new lifetime policy
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
"The pictures we been painting, my nigga"
Connected to a higher power
"How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga"
"Look, all I ever did was beat the odds"
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stopping like we hypnotized
"Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T."
"While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it"
"You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it"
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
"Clique too big, bread? gotta break it"
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
"No favors, no favors If she was flavor I won't savor"
"No taste buds, hoe later"
"Fuck you looking at, hater?"
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
"So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing"
"I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy"
"Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty"
"Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy"
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
"Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater"
"A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos"
"It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy"
"But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81"
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
"State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks"
"Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving"
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
"Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous"
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
"Like a missile, a thunder cloud"
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
"With a lamp post, door handle shutter"
"A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber"
"Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter"
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
"The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner"
"Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her"
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
"Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn"
"I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando"
"Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch"
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
"And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway"
"Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?"
"Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding"
"And yell, ""Wait!"", pleadingbut screaming is pointless"
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
"Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made"
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
"Cause I'ma Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it"
"You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it"
Everything lined up for the taking
"And what I need from em, no favors"
"Clique too big, bread? gotta break it"
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
"No favors, no favors"
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? no favors (I know you feeling yourself right now
But I'm not sure she's the one
"I would call them in) - ""Hey, I'm outside"""
What are you doing here? Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming
"And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming"
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
"And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it"
Too good to be true?
"Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again"
"Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?"
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
"Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again"
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
"Crown around it, thorns on it"
"Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't"
"Think I'd be back, did ya?"
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog
"But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at"
"I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate"
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
"Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count"
Only time I ever been out and about is
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
"Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up"
"Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong"
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
"'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?"
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
"Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir"
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
"Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer"
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
"I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page"
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
"On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform"
But as days pass in this shit
"And opinions sway, I can hear them say"
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
"Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage"
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
Fuck what these cynics say
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
"And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)"
"With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office"
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
"'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards"
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
"Kings never die I want it, I'm coming to get it"
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
"And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne"
"Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed"
"Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone"
"(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)"
"Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that"
"Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause (They say kings never die"
"Just ask Jam Master Jay, they"
"Just grow wings and they fly, so"
"Hands up, reach for the sky"
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over) Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
"Deacon of words, syllable genius at work"
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
Kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
"From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers"
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain't the same
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
"That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat"
"Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger"
"Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot"
I swear that I won't let you down
"I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground"
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
"Kings never die I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin"
"So far ahead, these bums is laggin'"
"See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'"
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
"Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'"
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
"Yeah, I said it, has-been"
"Hang it up, flat screen"
(Haha) Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma"
"I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine"
"I got bars, sentencin'"
"I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt"
"And I'll kick that hoe, punt"
"Forced trauma, blunt"
"You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front"
"You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it"
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
"You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock"
"I am a movie, camera block"
"You outta work, I know it's tough"
"But enough is enough Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain"
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
"Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain"
"An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame"
"You don't like it then peel off, bitch"
"Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,"
"and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut"
"So wipe the smile on your grill off,"
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
"Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off"
"Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod"
"Quit hollerin' 'Why, God?'"
He ain't got shit to do with it
"Bygones'll never be bygones,"
so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
"I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra"
"Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch"
"Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad"
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
"And caught her stealin' my music,"
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
"Look, two pees and a tripod!"
"The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?"
"Kick it back in its face, my God"
"It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd"
"But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) The wo-world is my punchin' bag and"
"If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots"
"Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me"
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
"Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon"
"You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end"
"I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic (I-I-I-I-Is)"
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
"Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho"
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"(Ni-ni-ni) ""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"""
"Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?"
"Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot"
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
"I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'"
"I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'"
"Overseas, church, Vatican"
"You at a stand, still, mannequin"
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
"I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite"
"And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike"
"Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite"
"I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's"
"Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs"
"I call the play, now do you see why?"
"These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli"
"(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli"
"These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli) A-a-a-a-all you lil' fagots can suck it"
"No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets"
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
"Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if"
You have the same passion that I have
"Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass"
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
"You know what time it is, so why ask?"
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
"It's (high class) meets (white trash) Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"
"Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon"

They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!

"Take your mother's warning, Roman"
Please!
Back to bed!
Run along!
Let's go!
Come on!
"Wash your mouth out with soap, boys"
"(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys) When I just a little baby boy"
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
"She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,"
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
"And I realized, she was the crazy one"
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore"
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
"Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you"
"I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you"
"Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos"
"Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?"
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,"
"Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"""
"You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late"
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
"I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches"
"Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!"
"Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all"
"Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on"
"Blood, guts, guns, cuts"
"Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me"
"Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me"
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef You better kill me! I'm a be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
"I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (cause why?)"
"'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)"
"I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (why?)"
"'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you Bitch I'm a kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you"
"In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you"
"Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!"
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
"It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid"
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
"And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse"
"To do it again, then, if he does it again"
"You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus"
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
"Here we go again, we're out of our medicine"
"Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me"
"Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me"
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
"We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Eh-heh, know why I say these things?"
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
"And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks"
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
"Twice? Whatever, I hate these things"
Fuck shots! I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
"Okay, I'm ready to go play"
I go the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
"Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?"
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet

You hear me? Answer me! Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
"Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me"

[Intro]
"Baby, light goes"
Where the eyelids go[Verse 1]
"You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone"
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
"I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right"
"I wake up, assessin' the damages"
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
"I wake up, all veggies no eggs"
"I hit the gym, all chest no legs"
"Yep, then I made myself a smoothie"
"Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie"
"Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago"
"Ãndale Ãndale E.I, E.I, oh, oh"
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
"Yeah, you wasn't mine though[Hook]"
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you[Verse 2]
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished girl
"You don't love me, you just pretendin'"
"I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'"
"Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago"
It's getting hot in here that's all that I know
"Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you"
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
"You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria"
"Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me"
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job[Hook]
And I drove back 30 hours
[Bridge]

Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is

The coldest story ever told
"Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless"
How could you be so heartless?
"Oh, how could you be so heartless?How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo"
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
"You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo"
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
"Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me"
"Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me"
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
"You got a new friend, well I got homies"
"But in the end it's still so lonelyIn the night, I hear 'em talk"
The coldest story ever told
"Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless"
How could you be so heartless?
"Oh, how could you be so heartless?How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know"
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up three A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for
"Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold"
"I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up"
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see

The coldest story ever told
"Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless"
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so heartless?
"Oh, how could you be so heartless? "
I'm living' in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
"Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it"
I guess every superhero need his theme musicNo one man should have all that power
"The clock's ticking', I just count the hours"
"Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power"
"(21st century schizoid man)The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open"
"We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling"
"Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'"
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
"In this white man's world, we the ones chosen"
"So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'"
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
"This is way too much, I need a momentNo one man should have all that power"
"The clock's tickin', I just count the hours"
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power
"'Til then, fuck that, the world's oursAnd then they say (hey) and then they say"
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
"More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole"
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
"My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in"
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
"He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted"
"I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts"
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
"My childlike creativity, purity and honesty"
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
"Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody"
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
"Thinkin', no one man should have all that power"
"The clock's tickin', I just count the hours"
"Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder"
"'Til then, fuck that, the world's oursAnd then they say (hey) and then they say"
And then they say (hey) and then they say
"And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)Holy, powers, Austin, Powers"
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
"They say ""How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"""
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
"At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit"
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
"I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick"
"I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?"
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'
"I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'"
"Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'"
"I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)Now this would be a beautiful death"
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything goNow this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything goNow this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything goYou got the power to let power go?

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home againI met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
"She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me"
"But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"""
And from that point I never blow her off
"Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off"
"They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off"
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
"In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding"
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
"Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me"
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
"She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""I'm coming home again"
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start againBut if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
"Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her"
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
"She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you"
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
"But they just not you"" and I just got through"
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
"Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud"
"Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud"
"Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around"
"If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!I'm coming home again"
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
"Cause I'm coming home againMaybe you, do you remember when?"
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
"Oh, now I'm coming home again"
"Maybe you, do you remember when?"
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
"Oh, now I'm coming home again"
Maybe we can start again

"Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that"
Drops some stacks pops is good

"Driving fast, lost control"
"Off the road, jaw was broke"
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
And I'll be taking all the stacksI got broads in Atlanta
"Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta"

"Black X6, Phantom"
"White X6, panda"
"Pockets swole, Danny"

"Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (more)"
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
"Head up high, I look to the light"
"Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright"
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
"Oh, no longer am afraid of the night"

"I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail"
You said let's do a good ass job with Chance three

This little light of mine
Glory be to god yeah

Wait 'til I get my money rightI had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
"Man, it's so hard not to act reckless"
"To whom much is given, much is tested"
"Get arrested, guess until he get the message"
"I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny"
And what'd I do? Act more stupidly
"Bought more jewelry, More Louis V."
My mama couldn't get through to me
"The drama, people suing me"
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
"I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman"
I guess the money should've changed them
I guess I should've forgot where I came fromLa la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
"Excuse me, is you saying something?"
"Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing"
You can't tell me nothing
"Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothingLet up the suicide doors"
"This is my life homie, you decide yours"
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
"But homie, this is my day"
"Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?"
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
"Ooh, they so sensitive"
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Then say something where you gon end up apolog'in
Let me know if it's a problem then
"A'ight man, holla thenLa la la la"
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
"Excuse me, is you saying something?"
"Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing"
You can't tell me nothing
"Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothingLet the champagne splash"
"Let that man get cash, let that man get past"
You don't need to stop to get gas
"If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes"
Cause how he move in a room full of No's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
"Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul"
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
"Treasure, what's you pleasure?"
"Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her"
"So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada"
"I'm in between, but way more fresher"
"But way less effort, cause when you try hard"
That's when you die hard
"Ya'll homies lookin' like ""Why God?"""
"When they reminisce over you, my GodLa la la la"
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
"Excuse me, is you saying something?"
"Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing"
You can't tell me nothing
"Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothingLa la la la"
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?

Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis

And look at all that he gave you

You know I never left you
'Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you

You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
"Hello my only one, remember who you are"
"No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakesHey, hey, hey, hey"
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
"You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that"
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
"I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you sayHello my only one, remember who you are"
You got the world 'cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
"So can you understand? One day you'll understandSo hear me out, hear me out"
"I won't go, I won't go"
"No goodbyes, no goodbyes"

But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that

Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
"Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass"
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
"Into real life, if you try to"
"So close, but so far"
"And so far, no cigar"
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow

"I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?"
"Hey, you remember where we first met?"
"Okay, I don't remember where we first met"
"But hey, admitting is the first step"
"And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect"
"And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep"
"But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect"
"And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving"
"So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas"
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
"But first, you gon' remember how to forget"
After all these long-ass verses
"I'm tired, you tired, Jesus weptI know you're tired of loving, of loving"
"With nobody to love, nobody, nobody"
"So just grab somebody, no leaving this party"
"With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth"
"Jerome's in the house, watch your mouthBound to fall in love"
"Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey) "
[Kanye West]

You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one is far to mean
"The wattered down, the one you know"
Was made up centuries ago
They it sound all wack and corny
Yes its awful blasted boring
"Twisted fiction, sick addiction"
Well gather round children
Zip it listen!Can we get much higher?
So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Can we get much higher?
So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Can we get much higher?
So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Can we get much higher?
So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
I fantasized about this back in Chicago
"Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago"
"That's me, the first year that I blow"
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
D.J's need to listen to the model's
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
"(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)"
"Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?"
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
"So much head, I woke up to Sleepy HollowCan we get much higher?"
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohLook like a fat booty Celine Dion"
"Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis"
Beyond the truest
"Hey, teacher, teacher"
Tell me how do you respawn the students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
"We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies"
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
"But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?"
"Fresh air, rolling down the window"
"Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low"
"Don't make me pull the toys out, huh"
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noiseCan we get much higher? So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohAt the mall there was a seance"
"Just kids, no parents"
Then the sky filled with heroines
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
"And the hell, it wouldn't spare us"
(And the fires did declare us)
"(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)"
(And moved her back in Paris)Can we get much higher? So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohOhCan we get much higher? So high"
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Can we get much higher? So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Can we get much higher? So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Can we get much higher? So high
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh "
"Oh when it all, it all falls down"
"I'm telling you oh, it all falls down"
"Oh when it all, it all falls down"
"I'm telling you oh, it all falls downMan I promise, she's so self conscious"
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
"But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny"
"Now, tell me that ain't insecure"
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
"She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
"Single black female addicted to retail and wellOh when it all, it all falls down"
"I'm telling you oh, it all falls downMan I promise, I'm so self conscious"
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
"I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!"
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
"We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us"
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
"And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop"
"Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupeOh when it all, it all falls down"
"I'm telling you oh, it all falls downI say fuck the police, that's how I treat em"
"We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom"
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
"That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?"""
"Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack"
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
"Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou"
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
"I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific"
I got a problem with spending before I get it
"We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit itOh when it all, it all falls down"
"I'm telling you oh, it all falls down"
"Oh when it all, it all falls down"
"I'm telling you oh, it all falls down "
"I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert"
"Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp"
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
"Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk"
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
"On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till"
"She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine"
"She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign"
"No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed"
"Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines"
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
"The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man"
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
"I swear this right here, history in the making, manWhat if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal"
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
"Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time"
"In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed"
"If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt"
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt!
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
"Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised"
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
"Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?"
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
"Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash"
"And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid"
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
"But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph"
"Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire "
Are you gonna be? Say that you're gonna be
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohShe said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross"

Faster
"Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist"
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messing wit Kan man and Twist in the Chi
"And I be sipping Hennessy, play some R&B;"
"While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G"
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
"Hit the stop light, move it to some Isaac"
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b dipping through the streets
"Bumping r&b;, and I got the leaf, on the 23's"
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
"Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex"
"You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me"

And every moment controlling me

"And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass"

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
"And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us"
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
"Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right"
"Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
"I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it"
"Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it"
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
"And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it"
"And if you did, then that's family businessAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)"
"They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)"
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these thingsThis is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
"Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture"
"Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?"
"Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV"""
"Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it"
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
"I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider"
But when we get together be electric slidin'
"Grandma, get 'em shook up"
"Aw naw, don't open the photo book up"
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
"You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude"
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
"But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bedRain, rain, rain go away"
Let the sun come out and all the children say
"Rain, rain, rain go away"
Let the sun come out and all the children sayI woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
"Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God"
And keep your face to the risin' sun
"All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog"
"And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog"
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
"Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman"
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
"Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion"
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
"We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)"
"They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)"
They don't mean a thing
"(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)"
"They don't mean a thing, a thingAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)"
"They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)"
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these thingsAll these things 
It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this eveningI'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe inNo matter what
You'll never take that from me
"My reign is as far as your eyes can seeIt's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'"
"So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)I'm a monster"

"So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)I'm a monster"
I'm a maven
I know this world is changin'Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid ofNo matter what
You'll never take that from me
"My reign is as far as your eyes can seeIt's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'"
"So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'"
"So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'I'm amazin'"
Yeah I'm all that
If i ain't on my grind
Then what you call that?Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive for victory
Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!
I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon
That's why I'm so goose
"Summer time, no juice"
"Big family, small house no rooms"
They like oh god!
why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
"He deserves an applauseSo amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' "
"Order, huh"
"Yo, we at war"
"We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves(Jesus Walks)"
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
"(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)You know what the Midwest is?"
Young and Restless
Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
"Try to catch it, it's kinda hard"
"Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method"
"They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us"
"Saying ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"""
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
"We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases"
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
"Well Mama, I know I act a fool"
"But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope(Jesus Walks)"
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
"I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long"
(I want Jesus)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
"I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so longSo long"
"(Jesus Walks with me)To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers"
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
"That means guns, sex, lies, video tape"
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
"(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)"
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now 
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
"For my, lady"
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I'm giving
For my children
I will die for those I love
God I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
"Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul"
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul[Hook: The Weeknd]
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me[Verse 2: Kanye West]
"See before I let you go, one last thing I need to let you know"
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that like time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times don't test me hoe
Now we finna lose all self control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
But I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...[Hook: The Weeknd]
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me 
"Who's faultLet's play the blame game, I love you, more"
Let's play the blame game for sure

"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else (else, else, else)"
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
"Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self"
Till about 2 A.M. and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
"Somebody helpLet's play the blame game, I love you, more"
Let's play the blame game for sure
"Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more"

I'll call you bitch for sureYou weren't perfect but you made life worth it
"Stick around, some real feelings might surface"
Been a long time since I spoke to you
In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
"Cause I definitely be having mineAnd you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional"
"Every time I hear bout other, nigga's is stroking you"
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Rubbing my name threw the mud
Who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like can't nobody get control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
"Even though I knew, he never told the truth"
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
"You probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls"
"All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl"
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
"And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame"
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
"Lets play the blame gameI love you, more"
"Let's play the blame game for sureThings used to be, now they not"
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
"With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing"
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
"Hatred and attitude tear us entirelyLet's play the blame game, I love you, more"
Let's play the blame game for sure
"Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more"
"Let's call out names, names, for sureI can't love you this much"
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
"No, I can't love you this much"
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this muchAnd I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thingI heard the whole thing
"Whole thing, whole thing, whole thingOh my God"
Baby you done took this shit to the nother motherfuckin' level!
Now a neighborhood nigga
Like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
"Goddamn, Goddamn! Who thought you how to get sexy for a nigga?"
(Yeezy taught me)
"You never use to talk dirty, but now you you goddamn disgusting"
"My, my God, where'd you learn that?"
(Yeezy taught me)
"Look at you, motheruckin' butt ass naked, with them, Jimmy Choos on"
Who thought you how to put some Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy thought me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga OK
"And I, and I love it"
"And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!"
"How did you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?"
(Yeezy thought me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I never fucked before
I was in there like ooh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
Who the fuck happened?
"Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?"
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
"You know what, I got to thank Yeezy"
And when I see that nigga I'ma thank him
I'ma buy his album
I'ma download that motherfucker I'ma shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
"Ahh, I still can't believe you got me this watch"
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
You went to bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted
"I saw this, I saw it"
Twista had this shit on in The Source
I remember! Twista had this on in The Source
"That's right, that's right!"
"Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!"
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
"Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well "
[Intro: Father's Children]
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
"Of cheating, stealing, never feeling"
"Pain of a brother, your dirty mother"
"Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are"
(Perfect!)[Hook]
"Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman"
"Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman"
(Yo!)[Verse 1]
"Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished"
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
"Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it"
"If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!"
"If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!"
"But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "

(You're the only power)
"You're the only power that can, ohhhh"
"Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh...If young Metro don't trust you I'mma shoot youBeautiful morning, give me some in morning baby"
Nothing unwanted
"Beautiful morning, give me some in morning baby"
"Nothing unwantedJust want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
"I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
If I ever instigated I'm sorry
Tell me who in here can relateNow if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'mma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met high
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
"I want to wake up with youBeautiful morning, give me some in morning baby"
Nothing unwanted
"Beautiful morning, give me some in morning baby"
"Nothing unwantedI just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
"I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
If I ever instigated I'm sorry
"Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, IPerfect[Part 2]Up in the morning, miss you bad"
Sorry I ain't called you back
The same problem that my father had
"All his time, all he had, all he had"
In what what he dreamed
"All his cash, market crashed"
"Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that"
Drops some stacks pops is good
Momma pass in Hollywood
"If you ask, lost my soul"
"Driving fast, lost control"
"Off the road, jaw was broke"
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
And I'll be taking all the stacksI got broads in Atlanta
"Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta"
Credit cards and the scanners
Hitting off licks in the bando
"Black X6, Phantom"
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
"Hundred killers, hundred hammers"
"Black X6, Phantom"
"White X6, panda"
"Pockets swole, Danny"
"Selling bar, candy"
Man I'm the mocho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
"Hope you killas understand meI just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
"I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
"Taking all the stacks, oh"
"Stacks, oh"
"Taking all the stacks, ohI got broads in Atlanta twisting dope, lean, and sipping Fanta"
Credit cards and the scanners
"Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner"
Whole buncha lot of shit
They be asking round town who be clappin shit
I pullin up stuff in the Phantom ship
"I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit"
"Black X6, Phantom"
"White X6, killing on cameraHow can I find you?"
Who do you turn to?
(How do I find you?)

"Let me tell you, I'm out here"
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far[Hook: Kanye West]
No more parties in L.A
"Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh"
No more parties in L.A
"Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh"
No more (Los Angeles)
"Please (shake that body, party that bod-)"
"Please (shake that body, party that body)"
"Please (shake that body, party that body)[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]"
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
"She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van"""
"Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty"
"Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie"
"Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler"
"I show you the ropes, connect the dots"
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
"Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite"
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
"Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians"
"R&B; singers and lesbians, rappers and managers"
Music and iPhone cameras
"This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think"
"That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean"
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
"That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck"
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
"I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards"
"You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence"
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
"The head still good though, the head still good though"
"Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
"Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal"
"Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me"
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
"Bottle service, head service, I came in first place"
"The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek"
"The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee"
"And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets"
"Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity"
"And yeah G, I was all for it"
"She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet"
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy[Hook: Kanye West]
Scary
Scary
No more parties in L.A
"Please, baby, no more parties in L.A[Verse 2: Kanye West]"
Friday night tryna make it into the city
"Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty"
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
"And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs"
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
"When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired"
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
"And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir"
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
"But don't worry, this one's so jammin'"
"You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'"
I be thinkin' every day
"Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades"
I be paranoid every time
"The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'"
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
"I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim"
"But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him"
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
"Every agent I know, know I hate agents"
"I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant"
"Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance"
"It's just me, I do it my way, bitch"
"Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans"
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
"But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans"
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
"God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam"
"Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me"
"Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!"
"I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full"
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
"Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out"
"We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots"
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
"She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that"
"She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that"
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
"Get money, money, money, money"
"Big, big money, money, money, money"
"And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em"
"Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker[Bridge: Larry Graham]"
"I just keep on lovin' you, baby"
And there's no one else I know who can take your place[Hook: Kanye West]
"Please, no more parties in L.A"
"Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh"
No more parties in L.A
"Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh"
No more parties in L.A
"Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh"
No more (Los Angeles)[Outro: Junie Morrison]
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
SWISH 
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
"Pardon, I'm getting my scream on"
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
"Like them black kids in Chiraq bitchFour in the morning, and I'm zoning"
"They say I'm possessed, it's an omen"
"I keep it 300, like the Romans"
"300 bitches, where's the Trojans?"
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
"But I ain't finished, I'm devoted"
"And you know it, and you know itSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)"
"I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)"
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
"I would've been blacked out on your assFour in the morning, and I'm zoning"
"They say I'm possessed, it's an omen"
"I keep it 300, like the Romans"
"300 bitches, where's the Trojans?"
"Baby, we living in the moment"
I've been a menace for the longest
"But I ain't finished, I'm devoted"
"And you know it, and you know itStop all that coon shit"
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
"Black out the room, bitch"
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
"Ready-ready for actionFour in the morning, and I'm zoning"
"I think I'm possessed, it's an omen"
I keep it 300 like the Romans
"300 bitches, where the Trojans?"
"Baby, we livin' in the moment"
I've been a menace for the longest
"But I ain't finished, I'm devoted"
"And you know it, and you know itSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)"
"I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)"
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
"I would've been blacked out on your assGod, God, God, God!"
"God, God, God, God! "
"Uh, Good morningWake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh"
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
"I mean, damn, did you even see the test"
"You got D's motherfucker, D's, Rosie Perez"
"And yes, barely pass any and every class"
Lookin' at every ass
Cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
"Homie, this shit is basic"
Welcome to graduationGood morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morningGood morningOn this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit wear cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters sayin' ya changed
Now ya doin' ya thangGood morning
Good morningGood morning
Good morningGood morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
"Some people graduate, but we still stupid"
"They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around"
"Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus"
"Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness"
"After all of that, you receive thisGood morning"
"Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'"
Get on down

"See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes"
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's
I used to love Kanye
"I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye"
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
"Called ""I miss the old Kanye"""
"Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye"
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to

I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
"See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes"
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's
I used to love Kanye
"I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye"
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
"Called ""I miss the old Kanye"""
"Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye"
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
"Pardon, I'm getting my scream on"
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
"Like them black kids in Chiraq bitchFour in the morning, and I'm zoning"
"They say I'm possessed, it's an omen"
"I keep it 300, like the Romans"
"300 bitches, where's the Trojans?"
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
"But I ain't finished, I'm devoted"
"And you know it, and you know itSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)"
"I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)"
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
"I would've been blacked out on your assFour in the morning, and I'm zoning"
"They say I'm possessed, it's an omen"
"I keep it 300, like the Romans"
"300 bitches, where's the Trojans?"
"Baby, we living in the moment"
I've been a menace for the longest
"But I ain't finished, I'm devoted"
"And you know it, and you know itStop all that coon shit"
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
"Black out the room, bitch"
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
"Ready-ready for actionFour in the morning, and I'm zoning"
"I think I'm possessed, it's an omen"
I keep it 300 like the Romans
"300 bitches, where the Trojans?"
"Baby, we livin' in the moment"
I've been a menace for the longest
"But I ain't finished, I'm devoted"
"And you know it, and you know itSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)"
"I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)"
But there's nowhere to go (now)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
"I go, I go, ay ay, I go"
"Up in the morning, miss you bad"
Sorry I ain't called you back
The same problem my father had
"All his time, all he had, all he had"
In what what he dreamed
"All his cash, market crashed"
"Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that"
Drops some stacks pops is good
Momma pass in Hollywood
"If you ask, lost my soul"
"Driving fast, lost control"
"Off the road, jaw was broke"
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
And I'll be taking all the stacks[Verse 2: Desiigner]
I got broads in Atlanta
"Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta"
Credit cards and the scanners
Hitting off licks in the bando
"Black X6, Phantom"
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
"Hundred killers, hundred hammers"
"Black X6, Phantom"
"White X6, panda"
"Pockets swole, Danny"
"Selling bar, candy"
Man I'm the mocho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me[Bridge: Kanye West]
"I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
"I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I"
"Taking all the stacks, oh"
"Stacks, oh"
"Taking all the stacks, oh[Verse 3: Desiigner]"
I got broads in Atlanta
"Twisting dope, lean, and sipping Fanta"
Credit cards and the scanners
"Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner"
Whole buncha lot of shit
They be asking round town who be clappin shit
I pullin up stuff in the Phantom ship
"I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit"
"Black X6, Phantom"
"White X6, killing on camera "
"Roll some, think I'll roll some"
"To know some, if we both honest"
"Who lasts? Yeah, you lie"
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
"I know, I know, I know when I see it"
"Riding down the 405, baby"
"Pacing, thinking, to myself"
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
"Don't know why, but I know a sign when I see it "
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
"Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
"(Oh oh you mad, huh?)Oh oh, she gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right?"
"Wanna catch that cab, right? Take back that bag, right?"
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse
I'm back on my Chicago shit and this aint what you want. Shout out to Lil Durk
"I'm the villain, no really I'm just chillin'"
"Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'"
"Mary, Mary all I need, pussy, money, weed"
"And all my women in doubles, I'm at the DoubleTree"
"All I hear hoes callin' out wildin', on the road like every day"
"We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say"
"No questions, no questions please, just on your knees"
"Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe"
"Gasp, on the gas, 'til I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed"
"All praise to Allah, not Ramadan but these bitches fast"
"Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then skrr"
"Who her? I forgot her nameOoh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
"Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
"Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody"
"Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody"
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
I guess I don't
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
"(Oh oh you mad, huh?)There go another lawsuit"
"In court so much, man I should've went to law school"
"Everybody brawlin', it was all cool"
'Til I hit the bartender with the bars-tool
I don't fuck with fake dudes wearin' fake trues
"I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, ""tru"""
"I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes"
"I'm talkin' Montell Jordan, this is how we do"
Bust a nigga head and then I lay low
"These niggas ass-water, get the Drano"
"She ain't really bad, she a photo thot"
"I should hire this bitch, she so damn good at Photoshop"
That Lexapro got me drowsy than a heart attack
I think they finally think they got me where they want me at
I got seven hundred emails in my inbox
"What that mean? I ain't callin' nobody backOoh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
"Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
"Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody"
"Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody"
I guess I don't
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"
"(Oh oh you mad, huh?)I be catchin' too many stares this evening, God fearin' but God knows I'm on a roll"
"At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like a corner store"
"Ain't my fault you ain't the man, made a plan, man it was planned"
"They sleeping on me like long flights, I pop a Xan on the way to France"
"Paparazzi like, ""oh that's him!"", pour that gin, let's get faded"
"Drinkin' like it's no tomorrow, what's today? I'm in the Matrix"
"Hater, please let me live my life, swear to God I be tryna do right"
But if she bad I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
"Uh, y'all pay the price, I pay the difference, it's just different"
"Save money, ain't nothin' different, gunshots and jumpin' fences"
"Hold on I'm tryna get loose, please don't get shit confused"
"Ask Don C, I've been lit, this 'Ye shit just lit the fuse"
"Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet (sshhh)"
Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'?
Like I was laying on my arm I'm on my side
"South side, I'm down to start a riotOoh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
"Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody"
"Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody"
"Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody"
"(Oh you mad, huh?)"

The sun is in my eyes whoo
Woke up and felt the vibe whoo
No matter how hard they try whoo

Hell you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now its Dennys in the morning spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction middle finger pedestrians
RB singers and lesbians rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras

She said she came out here to find an Alist rapper
I said baby spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
Youre dealing with malpractice dont kill a good niggas confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you dont know what a condom is
The head still good though the head still good though
Make me say Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles Buddhist monks and Capn Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service head service I came in first place
The opportunity the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these moving units through consumer streets

She said K Lamar you kind of dumb to be a poet
Imma put you on game for the lames that dont know theyre a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list I wasnt even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs somebody gon get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And Stacks man you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary

Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims

Careless whispers eye fuckin bitin ass
Neck ears hair legs eating ass

And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
Colin Powells Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obamas nation

New God Flow fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer write it in bold letters
They love a niggas spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think its good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him

But since you overdo it Ima pour more

Til we drown all these haters rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aww man you sold your soul

Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say

And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up

Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille

And last party we had they shut down Prive
Aint that where the Heat play Niggas hate ballas these days Yep

On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God
Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know
Im just a Chitown nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool 
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm
But Im looking for the one have you seen her
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
Thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface could it be more Tony
You love me for me Could you be more phony
Damn Yeezy and Hov where the hell ya been
Niggas talking real reckless stuntmen

Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain

Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance write my curses in cursive

Maybach bumper sticker reads What would Hova do
Jay is chillin Ye is chillin

Lord please let them accept the things they cant change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne
Im so appalled Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from yall
Baby youre fired your girlfriend hired
But if you dont mind Ima keep you on call
We above the law we dont give a fuck about yall
I got dogs thatll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers I need more rubbers
And if I dont use rubbers need more covers
Housekeeping I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get Os like Cheerios

That was a little joke voila
Praises due to the most high Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada

Shots left holes in his face about piranhasized
The old pastor closed the cold casket

If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
Youre gon end up pulling down niggas that look just like you

When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again
I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been trying to be mine

No use in me tryin to be lyin I been tryin to be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making man
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around

Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt

Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit

Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me

I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove

And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga

Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga

Had a few white girls asses flat as shit
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬¨àëA¬¨àëM
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aw money you sold your soul
Nah man mad people was fronting
Goddamn we made something from nothing
Youre my devil youre my angel
Youre my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my freedom youre my jail
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo

Whipped it out she said I never seen Snakes on a Plane
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her Get away 
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
All?í?Öhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piàö¬±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit realize
My dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids realize
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion realize
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize
I guess I cleaned up my act like Princed do realize
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible
I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyoncàö¬©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I aint talkin bout Cool J
See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way
Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on
Said he couldnt rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said You going to school Ill give you a summer
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess Im getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folksll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This aint no fashion show mothafucka we live it
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smokin sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing beats a day for summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship
Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool We assholes
Thats why we hear your music in fast forward
Cuz we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo
Nnnnnnow who the hell is this
Emailing me at

You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin on Candice

WHITE its getting late mami

If this is your first time hearin this
You are about to experience somethin so cold man
We never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
Took nothin from no man man Im my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flickin Starter coats man
Man you dont know man
We dont care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they aint finna say next summer Im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown
The second verse is for my dogs workin to that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say
You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite Cent song Questions
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say
My niggas
This is family business
And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your grannys picture
Now that youre gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas this cant be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man This Cant Be Life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture

I got an Aunt Ruth that cant remember your name
But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie you dont mean to be rude

And you dont wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
The second she storm out then he storm in
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt
We aint letting everybody in our family business
Yeah uh now Ima need you to kill the hypocrisy

And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan beat thats your last fault
Get what you ask for I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo

Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh
Pour the champagne let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil

Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic
Lyrically cant none of yall murder Ye
Cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Can I talk my shit again
Even if I dont hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding
My hat my shoes my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace
Thats Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone

Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey
Please dont start me
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory
What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please dont judge me uh for the followin
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin
Take off that Givenchy and lets get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
But if it falls in your lap its a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie

That are now ARs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild

So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Stupid questions like Is he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to him 
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity
and and and and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed

Whats scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said Get It Wet
Ooh girl your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars

But I still mess with a big girl
If you aint fit girl Ill still hit girl

Imagine if I aint say somethin

So I keep in mind when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fore it finally got through

But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going

Where I wanna go I dont need you

Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin

And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man
Big pimpin like Jigga man

And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
But I been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
Now this Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hos will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong
My godsister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
Driving around town looking for the best spot

Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland

And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
Thats that good shit we aint sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah thats pure man
From the place where the fathers gone the mothers is hardly home
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home

Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin

This the type of music that you make when you round that
You cant buy this Superflyness like a shine is
Your Highness is performing look how long the line is
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
Its what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Thats so novice Im so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
And yall feeling it but I expected it
If its classic its gon last forever then
Im everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
Thatd turn my life to Stephen Kings
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole

She never let it go oh
Just looking at your history
Youre like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take it to this degree
Well lets agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh

Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again

Like them eskimos what would you do for a Klondike
Or two dykes that look Christina Milianlike
Hm Ill be on time for that
I aint thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo Ill be there in five minutes five hours later
Ill be there in five minutes go head ride with it
Im so live with it look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know its late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah
We gon to Mass today we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
Thered always be somebody that shoot down any dream
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say Yo no hablo inglàö¬©s
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now Ill speak from the heart yall all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
Such an easy morning we on a ride
And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They dont want black people to think and drive
I mean my whole team bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week
And the weather wasnt barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott
Did I mention GOOD Music and forever we hot
Motherfucker are you ready or not
Merry Christmas to all and all a good night
Huh now we all livin the good life
Yeah though its forty below the wind chill
And we wipin snow up off the windshield
Its still wonderful night to be alive baby
And Im so happy Im with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin for the mall dont trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that You the star at the top of my Christmas tree 
My only question is Where my presents 
She said Shhh she got a gift for me that aint for the kids to see
Well I like the way you think mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink mami

Stop that
What you want some Patron

I mean I promise yall
You fine and all
And your girlfriend she kinda raw
But she not like you
No she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep Im tired of yall
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
See you know my style
Im very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said daddy thats the reason why you had me
Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called nigga
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Im an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnt have the ends
I wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
Im spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we aint finna change so well never agree again
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
Im spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say Ive been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
Ill be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
Im not right dog Im slightly off
Im paranoid like bonin raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea thatll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said I just cleaned up
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt
Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like Who this newer guy
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasnt bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hypeman
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Roll some think Ill roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
I peep the McCartneys Stella got her groove back
Hold on lemme ask you why you spend your money on that shallow shit
Why dont you buy some bigger tits
Something thatll last you
I couldnt tell you if Halles really real
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel

Maybe cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible
I wish all wack niggasd get out the game

You wouldnt wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game
Wack nigga the beat go duh duh da 
And then yo flow go way the fuck off

Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her nieces graduation man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater

She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend

Dont be acting like no actress if we preaching then we practice
Dont be reaching dont be touching shit
We in Kanye Wests Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian
Uh Uh
Lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a New Balance before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I dont wanna have to check you
Im as Chi as buckfiftys and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid
McDonalds with the flow served over over a billion
Youve seen the video words over the building
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling I wish I could give you this feeling
And when The Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be
I learned my lesson now I only fuck hoes thats close to me
Dont get me wrong you still gotta live close to me
This aint a song I made for ugly hoes to start approachin me

Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane
I just spit probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club

What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now Im standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
Thats good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car

The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Man will he come back and save the day
Fly across the earth put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away then we performed CPR
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimpd My crib so I must exhibit
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit
Verbal asked me do I need a pen
Not right now
Everything I write now

But Im so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard Ill be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the B got me body
There fees in the party
Chillin in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow

Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin

I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt

Everybodys saying we need something special
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box reach for it through the threshold

Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters Holla
We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters
And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was QTip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips

Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out

Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

Full messages on emails
But they hiding something like shemales

Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind
Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history

Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again

They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked

Ever since I been flossin

Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I aint eva eva accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm yea that something to ponder
The money I make on this ones for Donda
Thats West to you you the next
I cant hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Man how did she bring it up How did she break it down
Man you at the clinic Dog slow down thats your child
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her Man dont say that
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he from the street
He gon want him some strippers
And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
This my first Rolex it dont even be tickin
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean Im into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured
Yeah Kanye to the yeah
Im with this bad Ethiopian chick drinkin straight up liquor
I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs
Have girls feet lookin like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with a name some rhyme nameless
Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause Im Im tryin to make it to Uranus
See thats a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys
Naw she talking bout a couple of kids for me aww
Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin Cheers to you for your future years of pain
Like Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
I got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler
Damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin killer Cali gettin weeded

Now we feel the good vibrations
So many BIs so much inspiration
Hey miss
Whos there
No time to do hair

The show tonight
So get right
You look aight
Lets club now
A rub down
Starts flavor while we grind in the theater
Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look
Dont change the facts about these plaques
Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch

From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghosts style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well
Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around
My man said Lets call some girls that we know
Sometimes I wanna say Fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Now this weed drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me thats an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin
Girl told you dont leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon leave your ass
But when he get low he gon need your ass
If he cryin callin bawlin
Yallve been together too long for all this name callin
Yallll be back together in a day or two
Yeah we be makin up but when we makin up
All were makin up is the truth
Damn I know she love me oh
But Im in the Matrix and Im feelin Im Neo
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah
But Im a Gemini thats bossy like a Leo
And sometimes I dont know what side Im on
I just know this Patràöân got me gone
And Ive done fucked up so bad that I cant go home

If I come in the middle of the night then Myleka Imma do whatever you like
Good morning to umm I dont remember your name
But I remember the brain here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to ChiTown where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down

But her gear is bangin she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise she said I aint bonin you
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said Ye you dont love me
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
Listen yo

Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I cant restrain they real

For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats

Im tryin to take this money like Rob and G Dep
Then Imma take you to the house like Trick and Trina
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she a Christian
My White girl wanna move back to Michigan
Im pulling girls off the bench like a sixth man
Im in the club doing the same ol two step
While Omegas doing the same ol Q step
I have my money on my mind I was thinking green
She a pledge AKA she was pink and green
I want a good girl she want a gentleman
We saying the same thing like a synonym
I wasnt really spitting game I was scrimmaging
My penmanship so hard it needs censorship

Brand new Ferraris I gotta make the donuts
CRS is like a hiphop Chris bonus

To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino Da Vinci getting Benjies get half off of Fendi
Half of thats to Cindys
Hopped out the spaceship put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York but ChiTowns the city
Get my groupie hoochies Gucci Monica Belluccis
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies

But let me check your account haha no sir
Niggas be lovin the old Ye they sayin the new Ye that nigga be spazzin
But when Ali turn up and be Ali you cant ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon and make up lies but Im so sanctified

And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
People sayin Ye we need another Yeezus Ross grunt
Lames try to tell me Cut the wildin out out
But who the fuck is you reachin
Pass me bottles champagne procession
Thats that Holy water sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message said Im too aggressive
Really Me Too aggressive
You say you wrong you wrong Im right Im right
Youre wrong we fight
Ok Im running from the light running from the day to night
Oh the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try its too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh you call upon God
We keep these Gs in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So Imma be at least about a hour late

New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said hey Ye

Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls

A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
Thats real love mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of
No ones prepared for the scale of this and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State youre looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture tailormade
Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh Im breaking out the damn cage aghh
Hannibal Lector my American Psycho

Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Im stupid but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout you know who I dont know who you talking bout
Unfortunately for the rest of yall

And even though they focus on just the flaws
They still gonna annihilate the festivals
And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
Yeah yeah yeah Ive been known to cover up my eyes
With the Ray Beons
Flashing lights the stress of life
Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like theres no tomorrow

After all these longass verses
Im tired you tired Jesus wept
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra

You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as theres permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up am

Thinking bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos one read No Apologies
The other said Love is Cursed by Monogamy
Its something that the pastor dont preach
Its something that a teacher cant teach
When we die the money we cant keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain aint cheap
Preach

So lets get on with it
We couldve been somebody

When you tried your first molly

Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there aint wrong with me
Something strange is happenin
You couldve been somebody
We couldve ugh we couldve been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body

Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us

Then she said she impregnated thats the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you cant abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you cant afford that

But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls cause its hot right

And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
Colin Powells Austin Powers

New God Flow fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer write it in bold letters
They love a niggas spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think its good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him

Til we drown all these haters rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars money girls and the clothes

Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say

And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up

On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolvesÄãÄãÄã
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God
Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know
Im just a Chitown nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said Äútake them glasses off and get in the poolÄù
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm
But Im looking for the one have you seen her
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
Eighteen years eighteen years
She got one of your kids got you for eighteen years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Shouldve got that insured Geico for your money
If you aint no punk
Holla We want prenup We want prenup Yeah
Its something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gon leave with half
Eighteen years eighteen years
And on the th birthday he found out it wasnt his
Now I aint saying you a gold digger you got needs
You dont want a dude to smoke but he cant buy weed
You go out to eat and he cant pay yall cant leave
Theres dishes in the back he gotta roll up your sleeves
But while yall washin watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week its the fries
So stick by his side
I know theres dudes ballin and yeah thats nice
And they gonna keep calling and trying but you stay right girl
And when you get on hell leave your ass for a white girl
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
Thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface could it be more Tony
You love me for me Could you be more phony
Damn Yeezy and Hov where the hell ya been
Niggas talking real reckless stuntmen

Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain

Couture level flow is never going on sale

And pray that all of their pain be champagne

Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from yall

Housekeeping I mean goddamn

Sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr
She like fuck it Ill just stay down here and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her babydaddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Man I promise Im so selfconscious

Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy

Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our acres
And for that paper look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coupe
I say fuck the police thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
Well buy a lot of clothes when we dont really need em

In some relations youre just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well thats cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist well I guess thats on one basis
I only like green faces
Maybe its cause she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldnt have helped

Peekin through the keyhole the door locked by myself
And Im feelin it right now cause its the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka blocka blockablocka blocka
Pour a little champagne cranberry vodka

Shots left holes in his face about piranhasized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church aint got enough room for all the tombs

I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
soldiers died in Iraq died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh real niggas just multiply
And they say by I was supposed to die
So Im out here celebrating my postdemise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
Youre gon end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up Blood What up cuz Its all black I love us

So we wont take the time out til we reach the TOP
From parolees to hold Gs sold keys low keys
We like the promised land of the OGs
In the past if you picture events like a black tie

Whats the life expectancy for black guys
The systems working effectively thats why

Park they ass outside til the evenin end
When I go raw I like to leave it in
When I wake up I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again
I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been trying to be mine
She a Delta so shed been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin I been tryin to be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making man
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
But he wasnt talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt

She dont believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov

Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga

Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬?A¬?M
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes

Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime

Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo

With all these gossiping nopussygetting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham I need another costume
PETAs mad cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man Jay they dont really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urrr that they killed Pac in
Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up hands up then the cops shot us
You know what the Midwest is Young and restless
Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace
And next these niggas might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless gasps
Try to catch it gasps its kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be askin us questions harass and arrest us
Sayin We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
Huh Yall eat pieces of shit Whats the basis
We aint going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move

To the hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even the scrippers
Jesus walks for them
To the victims of welfare for we livin in Hell here hell yeah
Jesus walks for them
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we dont think
I aint here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out
Wake up Mr West Mr West
Mr Fresh Mister by himself hes so impressed
I mean damn did you even see the test
You got Ds muthafucka Ds Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic welcome to Graduation
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
Im like the fly Malcolm X buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a ki
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed now you doing your thang
Good morning look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world complacent career student
Some people graduate but be still stupid
They tell you read this eat this dont look around
Just peep this preachers teach us Jesus
Okay look up now they done stoled yo streetness
After all of that you received this
Im the one baby yeah Im the one baby
Since God gave his only begotten son baby
Its hard preachin the gospel to the slums lately

You on a run baby you on a run baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds baby
You think you me but you aint me what you done lately
Mhm thats cool but I been runnin on the sun baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson Jackson Jordan Michael Phelps
Yeahhh had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip Yeeeaaaalmmp
Welcome to the good life where niggas who sell D
Wont even get pulled over in they new V
The good life lets go on a living spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life it feel like Atlanta
It feel like LA it feel like Miami
It feel like NY summertime Chi
Ah Now throw yo hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Yall pop the trunk I pop the hood Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass I got to look sorry
Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who aint on TV
Cause they got mo ass than the models

Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly it feel like DC
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ay this is the good life Welcome to the good life
Homey tell me whats good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood Welcome to the good life
Like Im new in the hood
The only thing I wish I wish a nigga would Welcome to the good life
He probably think he could
But but I dont think he should Welcome to the good life
told me go head switch the style up
And if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Whipped it out she said I never seen Snakes on a Plane
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her ÄúGet awayÄù
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
AllÅhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi?±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit realize
My dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids realize
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion realize
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize
I guess I cleaned up my act like Princed do realize
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible
I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc?©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I aint talkin bout Cool J
See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way
Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on
Said he couldnt rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said You going to school Ill give you a summer
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess Im getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folksll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This aint no fashion show mothafucka we live it
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smokin sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing beats a day for summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship
Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool We assholes
Thats why we hear your music in fast forward
Cuz we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo
Nnnnnnow who the hell is this
Emailing me at
Telling me that she plus doubled
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
WHITE its getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend his name Kweli
You mean Talib Lyrics sticks to your rib

Then maybe Ill be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high
Im in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir Chanel Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep speak that Jourdan Dunn language

Coco Rocha Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio Anja Rubik
Get Olga Kurylenko tell her Im very single
Abbey Lee too Im a freak boo

You are about to experience somethin so cold man
We never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
Took nothin from no man man Im my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flickin Starter coats man
Man you dont know man
We dont care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they aint finna say next summer Im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown
The second verse is for my dogs workin to that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say
You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite Cent song Questions
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say
My niggas
This is family business
And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your grannys picture
Now that youre gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas this cant be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man This Cant Be Life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture
Abi remember when they aint believe in me

But when we get together be electric slidin
Grandma get em shook up
Aw naw dont open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that cant remember your name
But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie you dont mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you dont wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
The second she storm out then he storm in
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt
We aint letting everybody in our family business
Yeah uh now Ima need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy

Immature adult insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan beat thats your last fault
Get what you ask for I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo

Straight to jail yo in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer tell em I said Hello

Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh
Pour the champagne let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now Im in the Louvre lookin for fossils
Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic
Lyrically cant none of yall murder Ye
Cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Can I talk my shit again
Even if I dont hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding
My hat my shoes my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace
Thats Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona Im zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey
Please dont start me
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory
What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please dont judge me uh for the followin
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin
Take off that Givenchy and lets get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
But if it falls in your lap its a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie
I do it for the forefathers yeah the street authors
That are now ARs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild
You aint get the memo Yeezys back in style
Now one room got Gidget the other got Bridget
Whats more tripped out dawg is they sisters
Nah you aint listen they black they sistas
They momma named them after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Stupid questions like ÄúIs he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to himÄù
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity
and and and and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed

Tell me whos invited you your friends and my dick
Whats scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss I forgot your name
Thank you God bless you good night I came I came I came
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said Get It Wet
Ooh girl your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars

But I still mess with a big girl
If you aint fit girl Ill still hit girl

OK more now hop in the Benz

Hustlers gangstas all us ballas

But itd be wrong if I aint say nothin
Imagine if I aint say somethin
Wouldnt none these niggas say nothin

And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know never never know

I cant keep my cool so I keep it true
I got something to lose so I gotta move
I cant keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fore it finally got through
You lose you lose

But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll only God knows
If I be with you baby Im confused
You choose you choose
Im not loving you way I wanted to
Where I wanna go I dont need you
Ive been down this road too many times before
Im not loving you way I wanted to

And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man
Big pimpin like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure its
And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
But I been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
Now this Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hos will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong
My godsister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
Driving around town looking for the best spot

Right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you round that
You cant buy this Superflyness like a shine is
Your Highness is performing look how long the line is
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
Its what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Thats so novice Im so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
And yall feeling it but I expected it
If its classic its gon last forever then
Im everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
Thatd turn my life to Stephen Kings
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh
Just looking at your history
Youre like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take it to this degree
Well lets agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh
Golly more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to pologize to Mos and Kweli probably
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain Carti lens and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again
And its still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
Whatcha gon buy next Whatever new trend it is
Im tryin to spend my stacks
And Im so broke I look back like Damn was I on crack
I mean twelve platinum chains was I on that
What the hell was wrong with me dog
Sing along with me yall
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a PhD a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
And givin head is like a whale thats usin a toothpick
Well Im in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for free
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it aint gon cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And Im still actin calm denamuhh
She asked Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was
While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin off dont get no rich nigga
Give ME some head thatll really piss him off
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or til I go crash
Whatever comes first Im prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second Ill be there with my weapon
Pullin up in the Lexuses one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin me messages
K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed drink and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam
So say my name like Candyman
And Imma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
You cant take that all at one time ya gotta breathe
Stop all your blood clot cryin I was flyin
Made it to school with barely nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm yeah I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah I dont wan be broke when Im
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr West theres no good classes and thats what yo ass get
Not even electives Not even prerequits
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds
Now Im in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muhfuckers underachievin
Man this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if Im too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo
Like old folks pissin I guess it all depends oh oh
Stop your cryin baby
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
Thats right thats right thats right thats right
And when you get back she gon start up a fight
That night that night that night
Baby its too late for that lately Ive been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos what would you do for a Klondike
Or two dykes that look Christina Milianlike
Hm Ill be on time for that
I aint thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo Ill be there in five minutes five hours later
Ill be there in five minutes go head ride with it
Im so live with it look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know its late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah
We gon to Mass today we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
Thered always be somebody that shoot down any dream
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say Yo no hablo ingl?©s
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now Ill speak from the heart yall all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
Such an easy morning we on a ride
And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They dont want black people to think and drive
I mean my whole team bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week
And the weather wasnt barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott
Did I mention GOOD Music and forever we hot
Motherfucker are you ready or not
Merry Christmas to all and all a good night
Huh now we all livin the good life
Yeah though its forty below the wind chill
And we wipin snow up off the windshield
Its still wonderful night to be alive baby
And Im so happy Im with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin for the mall dont trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that ÄúYou the star at the top of my Christmas treeÄù
My only question is ÄúWhere my presentsÄù
She said ÄúShhhÄù she got a gift for me that aint for the kids to see
Well I like the way you think mami

And your girlfriend she kinda raw
But she not like you

Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep Im tired of yall
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
See you know my style
Im very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said daddy thats the reason why you had me
Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called nigga
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Im an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnt have the ends
I wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
Im spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we aint finna change so well never agree again
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
Im spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say Ive been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
Ill be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
Im not right dog Im slightly off
Im paranoid like bonin raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea thatll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said I just cleaned up
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt
Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like Who this newer guy
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasnt bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hypeman
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Roll some think Ill roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
I peep the McCartneys Stella got her groove back
Hold on lemme ask you why you spend your money on that shallow shit
Why dont you buy some bigger tits
Something thatll last you
I couldnt tell you if Halles really real
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I dont need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She on the same program as Britney is you wit me
Thats why I respect Alicia Keys

You wouldnt wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game

She holding out she aint giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Yall been together ten years you deserve a m?©nage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her nieces graduation man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on give her a kiss and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
Im joking Im just serious I asked her
Dont be acting like no actress if we preaching then we practice
Dont be reaching dont be touching shit
We in Kanye Wests Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian
Uh Uh
Lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a New Balance before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I dont wanna have to check you
Im as Chi as buckfiftys and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid
McDonalds with the flow served over over a billion
Youve seen the video words over the building
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling I wish I could give you this feeling
And when The Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be
I learned my lesson now I only fuck hoes thats close to me
Dont get me wrong you still gotta live close to me
This aint a song I made for ugly hoes to start approachin me
You know how this go I diss hoes
Im very mean now my Roley face green now I bring your self esteem down
Hello you there
Yeah Im here

Monica Lewinsky on the dress you take her to the cleaners

I dont understand why they trippin if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane
I just spit probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now Im standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
Thats good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car

I got my superman power my superman cape
These the last hours but superman late
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Man will he come back and save the day
Fly across the earth put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away then we performed CPR
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimpd My crib so I must exhibit
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit
Verbal asked me do I need a pen
Not right now
Everything I write now

But Im so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard Ill be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the B got me body
There fees in the party
Chillin in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid

Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow

I see it in my dreams I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt

Everybodys saying we need something special
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world speak for us

Meanwhile she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
Ay pimp its Ye pimp
told me they fuck with me in the Bay pimp
So Imma ride down with the dos open
Yeah thats the way to get the hoes open
Yeah high inch stilettos with the toes open
And any haters get they nose broken
Now tell me when to go tell me where the hoes
She told me they was cold now you act like you dont know
Like ummmm ummmm Imma hit the liquor store
Imma be on the low Imma have my hoodie on
If you call out my name then you know they gon go
Dumb you fuckin up my mode man
I told you only call me by my codename
They already recognize me from my gold chain
The same one I gave Keyshia Cole man
Now go dumb like Cole on Martin Im retarded
Kanye to the
I ask God to help me fly away
And if not
Then please keep your eye on me
These niggas is bringing out the worst side of me
When you wired me
You inspired me
To become the higher me
These execs
All want the details
How I made the world bounce like
Full messages on emails
But they hiding something like shemales
So
We still
Pull up in Sprewells
The ice and me chill
Like Goldmember I love gold
Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind
Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again
Yeah history in the makin Do or Die
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
Thats how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks I done got Cnotes
So glad I aint take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
Fuckin with my girl today around threeoh
My man said lets call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it cant be enough
Ever since I been flossin
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They dont breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold Steve Austin
Claim that I boss em
Basically Diana Ross em
But whos to blame for all these fights
When you aint always wrong
Im just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I aint the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Lets talk about amnesia
Yeah you got that bad
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
And Imma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do
Mae said cmon Mike said chamone
Started up early like RavenSymon?©
Keisha KnightPull Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name
But yall cant hold me down like restraint
I took the T off out the word cant
round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin our fam to Iran
Im in the club with a henny ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me Im just a man
Right now Im trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just and em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I aint eva eva accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm yea that something to ponder
The money I make on this ones for Donda
Thats West to you you the next
I cant hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Man how did she bring it up How did she break it down
Man you at the clinic Dog slow down thats your child
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her Man dont say that
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he from the street
He gon want him some strippers
And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
This my first Rolex it dont even be tickin
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean Im into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured
Yeah Kanye to the yeah
Im with this bad Ethiopian chick drinkin straight up liquor
I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs
Have girls feet lookin like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with a name some rhyme nameless
Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause Im Im tryin to make it to Uranus
See thats a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys
Naw she talking bout a couple of kids for me aww
Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin Cheers to you for your future years of pain
Like Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
I got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler
Damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin killer Cali gettin weeded

Now we feel the good vibrations
So many BIs so much inspiration
Hey miss
Whos there
No time to do hair

The show tonight
So get right
You look aight
Lets club now
A rub down
Starts flavor while we grind in the theater
Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look
Dont change the facts about these plaques
Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch
me Quence and Plain Pat bitch
From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghosts style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well
Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around
My man said Lets call some girls that we know
Sometimes I wanna say Fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Now this weed drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me thats an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin
Girl told you dont leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon leave your ass
But when he get low he gon need your ass
If he cryin callin bawlin
Yallve been together too long for all this name callin

Yeah we be makin up but when we makin up
All were makin up is the truth
Damn I know she love me oh

I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise she said I aint bonin you
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said Ye you dont love me
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
Listen yo

Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel

I was kinda gone and lightheaded
And my jacket kinda fresh bright red
And as usual my pants tightthreaded
It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit
Dont get it twisted or dreaded
I am the king and will not be headed
To the morgue no time soon brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin
Thatll only get my engine revving
While yall on Im on

And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the rari and throttled it up

More than a drink but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin

Things that you fear but youre way to proud to
Say out loud

Hey Young World Im the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we cant let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes

Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldnt stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said I would if hell handle biz up in the sheets
Pop off like a thang thang
He keep keep
And every time that she bang bang
He skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you Cassie and Kim Kardashian
Maybe thatll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now yall can have sexy time its nice

Hopped out the spaceship put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York but ChiTowns the city

Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies
Im so ultra Im even over Oprah
But let me check your account haha no sir
Niggas be lovin the old Ye they sayin the new Ye that nigga be spazzin

So you can gon and make up lies but Im so sanctified
I dont sweat it wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
People sayin Ye we need another Yeezus Ross grunt
Lames try to tell me Cut the wildin out out
But who the fuck is you reachin
Pass me bottles champagne procession
Thats that Holy water sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message said Im too aggressive
Really Me Too aggressive
You say you wrong you wrong Im right Im right
Youre wrong we fight
Ok Im running from the light running from the day to night
Oh the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try its too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh you call upon God
We keep these Gs in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait

New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said Äúhey YeÄù

Blood on the collar
Thats real love mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of
No ones prepared for the scale of this and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State youre looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture tailormade
Til your screams in rage

Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Im stupid but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout Äúyou know whoÄù I dont know who you talking bout

And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
Yeah yeah yeah Ive been known to cover up my eyes

Flashing lights the stress of life

Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you You taste like whiskey when you kiss me oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you You say sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
"And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place"
"(Something), something about lonely nights"
And my lipstick on your face
"(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy"
Yeah something about baby you and I It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
"And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place"
"(Something), something about lonely nights"
And my lipstick on your face
"(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy"
Yeah something about baby you and I You and I
You you and I
You you and I
You you and I You and I
You you and I
"Oh yeah, we're gonna die"
"Without you and I We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent"
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life
"It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ (Something), something, something about the chase (six whole years)"
I am a New York woman born to rock you down
So want my lipstick all over your face
"(Something), something, something about just knowing when it's right"
So put your dreams up for Nebraska
"For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you You and I"
You you and I
Baby I'd rather die
Without you and I You and I
You you and I
Nebraska
I'd rather die
Without you and I It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on it's true
Need that picture of you

We'd be so fantastical Leather and jeans
We're rock glamorous

About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
"Lord, show me the way"
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
"But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare"
"It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware"
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons

About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
"Lord, show me the way"

I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
"But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'"
Stay

"Lord, show me the way"
To cut through all his worn out leather

Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
"Baby you gave up, you gave up I can't believe how you looked at me"
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke? I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
"You've left me speechless, so speechless"
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
"You've left me speechless, so speechless I can't believe how you slurred at me"
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
"All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams I can't believe how you looked at me"
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
"You've left me speechless, so speechless I'll never love again"
Oh friend you've left me speechless
"You've left me speechless, so speechless How? Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow"
Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you? And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up? If I promised boy to you
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
"I'll never love again How, how, how so speechless"
"You left me speechless, so speechless baby Will you ever talk again?"
"Oh boy, why you so speechless?"
"You've left me speechless, so speechless Some men may follow me"
"But you choose ""death and company"""
"Why you so speechless? Oh oh oh I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired"
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
"You could ever want, it's in my arms So baby tell me yes"
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
"I will be right by your side If I can't find the cure, I'll"
I'll fix you with my love
"No matter what you know, I'll"
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
"Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) Rub your feet, your hands, your legs"
"Let me take care of it, babe"
"Close your eyes, I'll sing your favorite song"
I wrote you this lullaby
"Hush now baby, don't you cry"
Anything you want could not be wrong So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
"I will be right by your side If I can't find the cure, I'll"

I'll fix you with my love
"(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love) If I can't find the cure, I'll"
I'll fix you with my love
"No matter what you know, I'll"
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)
"Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) I'll fix you with my love Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
"Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as
"Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah When he calls to me, I am ready"
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me
"Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down"
"Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown I'm just a holy fool,"
Oh baby it's so cruel but
I'm still in love with Judas baby
"I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby it's so cruel"
"But I'm still in love with Judas baby Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
"Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah I couldn't love a man so purely
Even darkness forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick you can
"Build a house or sink a dead body Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down"
"Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel"
"But I'm still in love with Judas, baby"
"I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel"
"But I'm still in love with Judas, baby"
"Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
"Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as In the most Biblical sense,"
I am beyond repentance
"Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind"
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
"Judas kiss me if offenced,"
"Or wear an ear condom next time I wanna love you, but something's pulling me away from you"
"Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to Just a holy fool, oh baby he's so cruel"
"But I'm still in love with Judas, baby"
"I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel"
"But I'm still in love with Judas, baby Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
"Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as"
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as
"Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time"
"You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together"
You'll be fine
Tell me what the hell do you know
What do you know
Tell me how the hell could you know
"How could you know 'Til it happens to you, you don't know"
How it feels
How it feels
"'Til it happens to you, you won't know"
It won't be real
No it won't be real
Won't know how it feels You tell me hold your head up
Hold your head up and be strong
"'Cause when you fall, you gotta get up"
"You gotta get up and move on Tell me, how the hell could you talk"
How could you talk?
'Cause until you walk where I walk
"It's just all talk 'Til it happens to you, you don't know"
How it feels
How it feels
"'Til it happens to you, you won't know"
It won't be real (how could you know?)
No it won't be real (how could you know?)
Won't know how I feel 'Til your world burns and crashes
"'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope"
"'Til you're standing in my shoes, I don't wanna hear nothing from you"
"From you, from you, 'cause you don't know 'Til it happens to you, you don't know"
How I feel

Happens to you
"Happens to you, happens to you"
"Happens to you (how could you know?) 'Til it happens to you, you won't know how I feel I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong"
"To crash the critics saying, ""is it right or is it wrong?"""
"If only fame had an IV, baby could I bear"
"Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here I live for the applause, applause, applause"
"I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause"
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
"The applause, applause, applause Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)"
"Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)"
Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)

"Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch"
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud
"Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch I've overheard your theory"
Nostalgia's for geeks
"I guess sir, if you say so"
Some of us just like to read One second I'm a kunst
Then suddenly the kunst is me
Pop culture was in art
"Now, art's in pop culture in me I live for the applause, applause, applause"
"I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause"
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
"The applause, applause, applause Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)"

(Last night) Our lovers quarrel (I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
Oh my (And the way that you looked at me)
"Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)"
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
"When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus]"
Last night
"Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)"
Doing really nasty things (you were in my)
"Damn, you were in my sex dreams (don't stop the party)"
Making love in my sex dreams (4x) [Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought (cause I'm broken)
Let's white- (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here!
(And I feel so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
"When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus 2]"
Last night
"Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)"
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
"Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)"
Making love in my Sexxx dreams
Don't stop the party (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
"Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you [Bridge]"
You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
"I think of him, I think of him [Speaking]"
"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks"
And oh my god
(*vomits and giggles*) [Chorus 3]
Last night
"Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)"
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
"Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)"
Last night
"Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)"
Let's keep it naughty (Doing really nasty things)
"Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)"
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my Sexxx dreams) [iTunes Festival Bridge]
"We were in the swimming pool. I was naked, so were you, and I wrote this song while we made love"
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies and now's the time for the trial with doubts and drawls
"(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [laughs]) Let's have some fun, this beat is sick"
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
"Let's have some fun, this beat is sick"
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick I wanna kiss you
"But if I do then I might miss you, babe"
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
"Guess he wants to play, wants to play"
"A love game, a love game Hold me and love me"
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds isn't enough
"For my heart to quit it Let's have some fun, this beat is sick"
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick Let's play a love game, play a love game"
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
"Doin' the love game Let's play a love game, play a love game"
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game I'm on a mission
"And it involves some heavy touching, yeah"
"You've indicated your interest, I'm educated in sex, yes"
"And now I want it bad, want it bad"
"A love game, a love game Hold me and love me"
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds isn't enough

"Doin' the love game Let's play a love game, play a love game"
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Doin' the love game I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your huh!
"The story of us, it always starts the same"
With a boy and a girl and a huh and a game
"And a game, and a game, and a game, a love game Let's play a love game, play a love game"
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
"Doin' the love game Let's play a love game, play a love game"
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
"Doin' the love game Let's play a love game, play a love game"
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
"(Let's have some fun, this beat is sick)"
Doin' the love game

Doin' the love game
(I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)
Doin' the love game I'm gonna marry the night

"'Cause I'm a wandering man, he said to me And what about our future plans?"
Does it seem we have even make sense?
"When I got the whole world in front of me So I said, ""I don't wanna be alone forever"
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
"But I can be tonight, tonight"" So I just packed my baggage and"
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
"But I can be tonight, tonight 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm"
"A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy"

"I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm"
"A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy, I'm And then he asked me,"
"Said, ""Baby, why do we love each other?"""
"I said, ""Honey, it's simple."
"It's the way that you love and treat your mother"" Thought that I would be alone forever"
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
"Baby, for life Would you go with me?"
(For life)
"See the world with me 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm"

And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
"And I want you to know, I am my hair I've had enough, this is my prayer"
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
"I've had enough, this is my prayer"
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
"I've had enough, I'm not a freak"
I'm just here trying to stay cool on the streets

"And this is my prayer, I swear"
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
"I am my hair, I am my hair Free as my hair, hair, hair"

"Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair Sometimes I waltz around"
Put on red highlights
Just because I want my friends
To think I'm dynamite And on Friday rocks in
High school dance
I got my bangs too hot
"That I don't stand a chance, a chance I just wanna be myself"
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
"And I want you to know, I am my hair I've had enough, this is my prayer"
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
"I've had enough, this is my prayer"

"I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bare I am my hair, I am my hair"
"I am my hair, I am my hair"
"I am my hair, I am my hair"

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
"I am my hair, I am my hair Ooh, my hair, my hair Tryin' to get control"
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
"Yeah, at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love"
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
"Mistaken for love, it wasn't love"
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
"But at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love"
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
"Mistaken for love, it wasn't love"
"It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion) (Where are you, 'cause I can't see you)"
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watchin' me
"Dilated, falling free"
In a modern ecstasy)
"(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you"
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Illusion (but I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (where are you 'cause I can't see)
(But I feel you watchin' me)
"Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)"
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy I'm over the show
"Yeah at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love"
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
"Mistaken for love, it wasn't love"
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
(Aah) you were a perfect illusion
(Aah) it was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
"It was a perfect illusion, illusion (illusion) It was perfect illusion"
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
"You were a, you were a perfect illusion It's like, I just love a cowboy you know"
"I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad"
But I'm just like
"Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse"
"And can you go a little faster?! Three am, Mustang speedin'"
"Two lovers, headed for a dead end"
"Too fast, hold tight, he laughs"
Runnin' through the red lights
"Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'"
"Big swig, toss another beer can"
"Too lit, tonight, prayin'"
On the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
"I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne"
"Baby let's get high, John Wayne Blue collar and a red-state treasure"
Love junkie on a three-day bender
"His grip, so hard, eyes glare"
Trouble like a mug shot
"Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission"
"One, two ya, the gears are shiftin'"
"He called, I cried, we broke"
Racin' through the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
"I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne"
"Baby let's get high, John Wayne So I go to the eye"
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
"Into our love storm Baby let's get high, John Wayne"
"Baby let's get high, John Wayne Last night"
(Our lovers quarrel)
I was thinking about you
(More than I can say)
And it was kind of dirty
(All night)
And the way that you looked at me
(Help me here)
It was kind of nasty
(Help me here)
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty) Help me here
'Cause I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our head Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
And I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
"I think of him, I think of him I can't believe I'm telling you this but"
I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams Don't call me GaGa
I've never seen one like that before
Don't look at me like that

"Baby, I'm a free bitch, I'm a free bitch Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track"
She won't walk away but she won't look back

She's a mess she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess she's a mess

'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
"Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls) Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin"
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
"(Tell 'em, girls) Baby loves to dance in the dark"

Hey yo You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
"About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills"
"If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still"
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
"Lord, show me the way"
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
"But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare"
"It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware"
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
"Lord, show me the way"
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
"But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'"
Stay
"Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'"
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
"But baby, I just need one good one"
"Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray"
I try to make the worst seem better
"Lord, show me the way"
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
"But baby, I just need one good one, good one"
"Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one"
"Baby, I just need one good one to stay Young, wild, American"
Lookin' to be somethin'
Out of school go-go'n for a hundred or two
Some asshole broke me in
Wrecked all my innocence
I'll just keep go-go'n
"And this dance is on you One, five, ten, lay a million on me"
"Before the end of this song Young, wild, American"
"C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?"
Rain on me a million
"I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart Oh, I"
"I might not be flawless, but you know"
I gotta diamond heart
"Oh, I"
"I might not be flawless, but you know"
"I gotta diamond heart Young, wild, American"
Head full of Jameson
Girl's playin' bad 'cause it doesn't pay to be good
A cruel king made me tough
Daddy's girl's never good enough
I'll just keep go-go'n
"'Cause this dance is on you One, five, ten, lay a million on me"
"Before the end of this song Young, wild, American"
"C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?"
Rain on me a million
"I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart Oh, I"
"I might not be flawless, but you know"
I gotta diamond heart
"Oh, I"
"I might not be flawless, but you know"
I gotta diamond heart Good thing I know what I'm worth
"Want a good thing, put the money down first"
Better get a good look baby
"'Cause soon I'm breaking out of here Young, wild, American"
"C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?"
Rain on me a million
"I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart Oh, I"
"I might not be flawless, but you know"
I gotta diamond heart
"Oh, I"
"I might not be flawless, but you know"
"I gotta diamond heart Diamond heart Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha I love that lavender blond"
The way she moves the way she walks
I touch myself can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time eh-eh eh-eh So happy I could die be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
"Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh So happy I could die and it's alright"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha I am as vain as I allow I do my hair"
I gloss my eyes I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place
I take my time I put it back
I touch myself 'til I'm on track Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time So happy I could die be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
"Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh So happy I could die and it's alright"
So happy I could die and it's alright
"So happy I could die and it's alright Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha"
"Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha"

Yeah I'll love you forever
"Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh So happy I could die and it's alright I came down the mountain"
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
"Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me"
He has a funny way saying forever too fast
"Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp"
For something he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
"But you, but you"
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
"But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold Got a baby sister who looks just like me"
She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece from Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
"Gets on the brink, and throws her off"
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
"But you, but you"
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
"But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold"
"Good as, good as, good as, good as gold I can carry you, but not your ghosts"
"Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh Hear my sinner's prayer"
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
"But you, but you"
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
"But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold"
"Good as, good as, good as, good as gold"
"Good as, good as, good as, good as gold (Verse 1:)"
"Hey babe,"
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy.
"I know that we got something special, boy."
"But lately I've been feelin' naughtier,"
than usual (Chorus:)
You see I
I need a love thats crazy don't you see?
I'm looking for someone that can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.
I'm sorry when I mention that I did not know.
You and me were kind of in complete.
Need someone to say me he loveth me. Give it up
Put it up
Not enough

Out of control [After-Chorus:]
Give it up just let your body Out of control

Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
I'm laying down on famous knives so everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I know could love and save me from myself
But maybe I'll just clean the shit off these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you VERSE:
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel
But was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool
So everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Maybe someone I love could save me from myself
Or maybe I'll just clean the shit off these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you CHORUS:
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note POST-CHORUS:
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die REPEAT CHORUS BRIDGE:
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriends limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold OUTRO:
"The final act of life will be my own hands to do,"
Ill be a Princess and die with you

"I fell down, I wish you were mine"
I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place

Pretend that I am you until it clicks

I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins
"Don't leave me, I"
Oh I will hate myself until I die My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
"Been hurting low, from living high for so long"
"I'm sorry, and I love you"
"Sing with me, ""Bell Bottom Blue"""
I'll keep on searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
"Each day, I cry"
"Oh, I feel so low from living high My heart would break without you"
Might not awake without you
"Been hurting low, from living high for so long"
"I'm sorry, and I love you"
"Sing with me, ""Bell Bottom Blue"""
I'll keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope [Verse 1]
"I always thought it was you,"
You always thought it was me.
"We always thought we were it,"
"Seemed like a real perfect fit,"
"Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. I always thought even though,"
We were so young we could grow.
"Up in the end it'd be us,"
"We'd take the F or the bus,"
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
"Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)"
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Verse 2]
I miss our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
"And we would watch Rocky IV,"
"The one where the Russian scored,"
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair. I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
"And cracked open our last beer,"
"Falling asleep in our tears,"
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you
"I'ts not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)"
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Bridge]
I found an old pair of
Keys in my purse that opened
The lockup we shared
"How did they get there, jerk?"
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work. I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
Off of seven years
Of our bad luck dating.
"I want one last night there,"
A Brooklyn Night affair. [Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
"Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)"
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Outro]
Its not that I don't want to love you
"Cause I really tried, and I"
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu Huh oh
Yeah yeah
Huh oh
Whoa woa
Oh I
I feel good
I walk alone
"But then I trip over myself and I fall, I"
I stand up
And then I'm OK
"But then you print some shit that makes me want to scream So do what you want, what you want with my body"
"Do what you want, don't stop, let's party"
"Do what you want, what you want with my body"
"Do what you want, what you want with my body Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me"
"If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry"
"Do what you want, what you want with my body"
What you want with my body! You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body My bones hurt from all the show hmm
But I don't feel the pain 'cause I'm a pro I
"I sink in and then I'm okay eh,"
"'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage eh So do what you want, what you want with my body"
"Do what you want, don't stop, let's party"
"Do what you want, what you want with my body"
"Do what you want, what you want with my body Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me"
"If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry"
"Do what you want, what you want with my body"
What you want with my body! You can't have my heart and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart (apart)
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party (ey!) You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but

Do what you want with me
"What you want with my body, world"
Help me now
What you want with my body (world)(what you want with my body)
"Do what you want with my body Come to me, in all your glamour, and cruelty"
Just do the thing that you do
"And I'll undress you Give it tight, sometimes the simplest move is right"
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you? A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything [Chorus]
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"ARTPOP, ARTPOP Come to me, without your sub-techs and fantasy"
Just do the thing that you do
"For my love is you Love is fly, I've flown my beaches with lover's side"
The color's palette you choose
Can profit you A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
my artpop could mean anything [Chorus]
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"ARTPOP, ARTPOP [Chorus]"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"ARTPOP, ARTPOP Brushes with darkness wont help you create"
your destiny of self but Artpop could mean anything
Anything
"I tried to sell myself, but I am really laughing"
Because I just love the music not the bling
Music not the bling [Chorus]
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"
"We could, we could, belong together (artpop)"

"You make my heart stop Hey girl, can you hear me?"
Are you holding out your heart?
"Hey girl, do you feel me?"
Sometimes I go too far

My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was always one man to love
"But in the bedroom the size of him's more than enough Do you wanna see me naked, lover?"
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
"Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?"

Downtown Just another way to prove I love you and it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say that makes me mad
"I'll turn away, I'll turn away, I'll turn away And think of different ways to keep my spirits up"
"And choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts We both know I could learn a thing or two"
"About relaxing, hey, I love you"
"And after all, it's just another day Oh, I could use some two or three"
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
"And smile at all the new strange I meet And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today"
"And create simple thoughts, I'll laugh in humble ways We both know I could learn a thing or two"
"About behaving, but I love you"
"And after all, it's just another day Come on, Mark Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman We both know I could learn a thing or two"
"About behaving, but I love you"
"And after all, it's just another day And after all it's just another day Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand"
"Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan"
"Remembering me, before it began"
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam
"But the ones who loved me, told me to stop"
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops
"A superwoman chick, you know that I am"
Some shit don't fly by me in a man 'Cause I do not accept any less
"Than someone just as real, as fabulous Don't want no paper gangsta"

Babe Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy you were getting ready to leave
I thought that baby you were done
Cause for a while you could barely look at me This time I thought that we`d be fine
That I`d forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words But baby you can not forget the past
Oh oh oh oh babe
Can not forget the past
"Oh oh oh oh, Still baby (Babe) I'm so unpredictable"
you don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around the second time around We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides baby by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed Last time we where hanging out
You were acting kind of strange
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry now it's me that feels this way
Oh oh oh oh babe
(My heart just speaks to me)
Its me that feels this way
Oh oh oh babe I now you are the one that is hurting I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around I`m not sure the best of way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more babe
This ferris wheel`s got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us babe
Not meant for us babe hey-yeah! I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
Its always harder
the second time around I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see

It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around The second time around I don't want to rule the world
There's a change I'm here to see
I walk alone on a lonely road
I've many wonders to believe You can try to hear the talk
Or selling out a masterpiece
You've got a trunk full of gold
I've got someone to believe This ain't about Kings or Queens
Ain't about You and Me.
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do? How can you deal with it (With it)
Do you just avoid the guilt
"Something you gotta I know,"
"If you can deal with me,"
"Shut your mouth, sip on that TEA! It's been so long"
Since I've had a sip and I get this feeling
I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight Red one lady gaga haha baby baby baby baby i anit gonna runaway runaway run run run run away
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
"Music is all I need. Baby, I just wanna dance"
I don't really care I just wanna dance
I don't really care... care... care (feel it in the air... yeah) [Chorus]
She's being a crazy dita disco diva... and you wonder:
Who's that chick? who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? who's that chick?
Who's that chick? who's that chick?
Who's that chick? who's that chick? Back on the dancefloor better not to take me home
Bass kicking so hot blazing through my beating heart
"French kissing on the floor, heart is beating hardcore"
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy on the crazy juice
"This will end up in the news Baby, I just wanna dance"
I don't really care I just wanna dance
I don't really care... care... care (feel it in the air... yeah [Chorus]
She's a mean and crazy dita disco diva... and you wonder:

Who's that chick? who's that chick?
"Who's that chick? who's that chick? Ultra sexual, the night has got me love sprung"

My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum oh oh uh oh
"Ultra sexual, the night has got me love sprung"

My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum... beating like a disco drum... [Chorus]

"Out the box, out of line"
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more. -chorus-
"'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it"
"Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it"
"Stickss and stones may break my bones,"
But chains and whips excite me.

"Who's that chick? who's that chick? The hills are alive,"
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
"For a thousand years The hills fill my heart,"
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark
Who is learning to pray I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before
"My heart will be blessed,"
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
"And then I don't feel so bad Edelweiss,Edelweiss"
Bless my homeland forever. Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
Till you find your dream A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Everyday of your life
For as long as you live Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
Till you find your dream I am so fab

He didn't even say goodbye
"He didn't take the time to lie Bang bang, he shot me down"
"Bang bang, I hit the ground"

Better call your boss tell him that your daddy's home
Take a couple days off
And take it off and leave nothing but your T-shirts and your panties on
"Feeling high but I'm hung real low looking sorta like a tripod,"
So power down your cell phone and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak
"(yea, shit fuck)"
It's the only words that you finna speak
Its about to get real x-rated
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do
But enough about me let me think
Should I be worrying about if I can handle you
Damn right I'm a get that thing and I'm a put my name on it
"All night I'm a whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it"
"I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up"
"You could be my fire cracker, my tongue finna' spark you up"
"Get ready for blast off, waterfalls gon' splash off"
You might lose around 4 or 5 pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off [Chorus]
Welcome to my sex room

"And when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up and iced down"
(In my sex room)

"Your the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten"
"I'm a get my video camera, lets make a movie baby"
You the star so as soon as I press record you gots to do me baby
"You can stare all in the mirror, take a peek at how good you lookin'"
"I'm a have your body smokin', take a look at what Luda's cookin'"

"We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggas"
"I'm from the D.E.C., tryin' to disrespect D.T.P."

With ho energy to do what ya do
Blew what ya blew
Screw what ya screw
"Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pulling on my coat tail"
An why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
"Hotel everybody, even the mayor"
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
Come on player once a ho always
And hos never close they open like hallways
An here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
An everybody wants some cause hoes gotta eat too [Chorus: x2] Cant turn a ho into a housewife
Hos don't act right

"Its a ho wide world, that we living in"
"Feline, feminine, fantastical, women"
"Not all, just some"

On taxes y'all writing off hos as dependents

With ugly chicks faces
But hos don't feel so sad and blue
Cause most of us niggas is hos too [Chorus] (Ho)

"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line"
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
"Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop"
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em

And the tell me what's they fantasy
"Like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"

"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the bath tub"
With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
"What's my name, what's my name, what's my name"
"Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie"
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
"Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up"
"That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert"
"Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt"
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
"Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid"
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
"Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes"
"On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes"
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
"Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt"
"Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs"
"Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"

"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy (Luda)"
How low can you go?(x8) (Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) Hahaha Luda! (Luda) [Verse 1]
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
"Face down, ass up"
The top of yo booty jigglin' out yo'jeans
Baby pull yo'pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
"BUT, how low can you go"
Lower than yo' mamas ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would of imagined it
Not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doin' it on the dance floor
Mad 'cuz I can't get with you
Just show me how to dance (OOOH)
I may not want to get low
So I'm post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib then
I might show you girls a thang or 2
Yeah I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus]
(Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) (Shawnna)
"I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,"
"Go low,(go low) lower than you know,"
"Go low,(go low) lower than you know,"
"Go low,(go low) lower than you know,"
"Go low,(go low) lower than you know, (Luda) [Verse 2]"
I be like knick knack paddy wack
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'till I get to the center
And let a reala nigga take you home
I can make this show stop
As soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' drop
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
"And if she really gettin low,"
Then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on T.V.
'Cuz I like that French vanilla and the caramel
"BUT, when it comes to chocolate"
I know that very well
"Asian persuasion, no discrimination"
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them Puerto Rican pecan
Peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cuz I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big well there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus] (Luda) [Verse 3]
"Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it"
Don't stop (get it get it)
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you working with
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yeah you a superstar
There's just a thing I gotta know
"So... [Chorus] Yeah, Welcome to Atlanta, jack and hammer and vogues'"
"Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'"
"A knock on the do', who is it?"
"I would happen to know, the one with the flow"
"Who did it?, it was me I suppose"
J-D in the Rollz and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
"Skatin down old Nat, Gat tooked and lean"
"I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team"
"No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean"
"I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams"
Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines
"Oink Oink, Pig Pig, do away with the pork"
Only siguar needs a steak knife and a fork
"Did you forget your fuckin manners, Im loose with banners"
"Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when i shoot the cannon"
"The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge"
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
"I pull up in the black Lotus, you're plaque's are bogus"
So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls
"You rackin' 'em up, Im big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up"
"In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Cadallacin' the truck"
"I cant loose with 22""s, Bitch thats whats up"
"Runnin in the back the fuck, runnin better than aquaduct"
"chil-li-li-li-li-n.. what Yo, Yo.. Yo..Yo, Yo,"

Runaway love Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
"Why she's all alone, and they never met her family"
"Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy"
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
"Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen"
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
"Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight"
Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
"She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her"
"Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her"
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back Runaway love

"Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her"
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
"Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises"
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
"Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out"
It's only one girl really knows what she about
"Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends"
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block

She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
"Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love"
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
"The days go by, and her belly gets big"
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
"Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion"

"Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets"
"Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread"
"Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed [Chorus] I got a college girl go to church every Sunday"
Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me
"But she so innocent, when she when she around her mommy"
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
"Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman"
"Sex all night, go to work every mornin'"
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise [Chorus] I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta

And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
"But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild"
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
"You may proceed, let the games begin"
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again [Chorus] I came to party like tonight will never end

Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
"Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers"
"It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor"
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
"Since everybody wanna piece, we gon' split ya wigs"
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
"You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around from me"
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout what kinda shits he on
"You disappear like ""poof, bitch be gone"""
"You think twelve gon' catch me, gimmie a break"
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof wood grain on the dash
"Sheep skin on the rug, +golden grain+ on the stash"
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
"We go front, back and side to side, what Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink"
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
"With the petal to the floor, radar in the grille"
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
"Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep"
"Nos tank in the back, camel hair on the seat"
"And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection"
'cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
"I'm about to take off, so f what ya heard"
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
"And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one"
'cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun You just got hustled for a wire of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash

Now them gulls up the block still runnin' they mouth
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the dirty south
Tell me what I'm gon' do? act a fool I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
"See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy"
Off the off ramp doin' about a hundred and fifty
"Rollin' through east pernium, on way to ben heel"
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is fire 'cause we stomped you out
"And yeah, we blow trees and beez, that's fantastic"
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil john cue and get a +change of heart+
"It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams"
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
"Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and steams"
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool

A toast to life They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
"So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow"
I was born for the fast life
"I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford"
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
"For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh"
"Na na hey, oh"
"Na na hey, oh"
"Na na hey, for the rest of my life If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead"
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
"Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall"
"Written on my tombstone should say ""Women, Weed, and Alcohol"" That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow"
I was born for the fast life
"I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford"
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
"For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh"
"Na na hey, oh"
"Na na hey, oh"
Na na hey If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
"A toast to life I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time"
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
"And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice"
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Chorus: (2x)
I hate it when it's too many niggas
Not enough hoes
Too many rookies
Not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all yall can suck my dick I got em whip like miracle
Ludacris lyrical fool
We dirty south
Shut yo mouth
We rock jewels
No holds barred
But obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anymore like ya
Hell nah
I treat humans like students
Fail yall
So turn your books to page 69 and start sucking
When organize drop the track and start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed then start fucking
You wanna be starting somethin
Get out the booth and let me tell yall the truth
We kick down doors
Save all the h20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch what stank hoes
Stay chromed out
And thats on or off road
If you know what I mean
Proceed to stay clean
Light skinned nigga turned red but get green
Inhale some of that dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans Chorus (2x) Boy you done lost yo mind
Nah I lost my virginity
And I shot quick like that fool that shot Kennedy
Whats the remedy
Henessy coke
If you cut all yo money you still be half broke
Ashes to ashes
Smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
Take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and thangs
And watch for imposters thats been in the game
We invented the game
And yall just got hipped
Man what that smell
Probably you're upper lip
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if its cigars in that purple colored dank
Filling in the Gump wit no track of Tom Hanks
Go put this in your jaw like weeners and beef franks Chorus (2x) I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I'd like to get paid
Arrive to a ho and I'd like to get laid
Right up on my back like rugs and floor mats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bosack
Did you know that
Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stove so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki in blew flames
Rearrange
Same braud different night
Pass the E&J; and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten'd dude that's on your same flight
"The highlights that I neva high ass light Chorus (2x) Cadillac grills, Cadillac mill's"

Hand me down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50 pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks

Forty glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
"Lie through your teeth you could find your mouth, cold"
"And rip out ya tongue cause of what ya mouth, told"

"Bells are ringing, children si"

"Santa Claus comes to town Yeah, I tell 'em all I want for Christmas is two gold front teeth"
And ten carat diamonds on a fat gold wreath
"That I could wear around ma neck, get money in respect"
"Tell Santa Claus to bring a ten million dollar check So I could spread a lil' cheer, fly a couple leers"
"Eat a lil' chicken, drink a couple beers"
Kick back and just chill like a player would do
"Remix all the Christmas carols then I play 'em for you Luda, turn it up until I wake up all the neighbors"
They say that I'm a nuisance but I say they all some haters
Just because I'm poor they always calling me a faker
"And 'cause my Christmas tree decorated in toilet paper But little do they know, they bout to see a show"
'Cause when they come up out the house

Frosty's never seen nothing quite like this
And St. Nick's never seen nothing quite like 'Cris
"So um Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus"

"Ice skating in the drive way, I'ma do it my way"
"Eggnogs got daddy swerving on the highway Chains on the tires, ice up on the window"
"10 degrees Fahrenheit, freezing as the wind blow"
Help me take my boots off and my snow suit off
Get up in the house and my nose is redder than Rudolph's I think I need some help with the buckle on my belt
And if Santa doesn't show I want his cookies and his milk
"Tell him I need a jacket, New Jordans and a Xbox"
New suits for church and a couple pairs of dress socks Stuff my stockin' with Jolly Ranchers and candy canes
"Invite my aunties and uncles, let's do the family thing"
Meanwhile I'm hoping Santa got my wish list
"So I could wake up to a very Merry Christmas Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus"
Right down Santa Claus lane
"All his reindeer, all his reindeer"
"Pulling on the reins Bells are ringing, children singing"

"I guess it's prolly 'cause I been naughty not nice But I'ma straighten up my act, get up on track"
Make a couple bucks and buy mama a Cadillac
And then maybe Santa Claus will come around my way
"So all the kids on my block can look up and say, hey Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus"

"I'm boss to all employees, and I'm here to teach the principle"
"Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Vorhees Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man."
I'm tired of this shit man.
"Man I try to rap for the nigga,"
"I try to get a nigga tracks,"
He ain't hearing my shit.
Man for real.
"Man my four-year-old son can rap better than that nigga,"
Man that nigga garbage.
"Man I got talent too, the nigga ain't hearin me."
"Man is this shit on? 'Cris, c'mon 'Cris."
"'Cris, f'real man."
"Fuck you nigga, man fuck you Fuck you too! What you want to do, scrawny nigga"
But I got a arsenal of automatics down to twenty-twos
"Know how to use 'em, fight dirty as shit"
I throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a clique
You see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And coming up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
"I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos"
"With five strippers, four wives and three amigos"
I go scuba diving in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinned version of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they called me bingo
"Cause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle"
"Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled"
And I stay with more bullets than yo' Billboard singles Ho that is just too much! You just gotta give applause
"He is definitely all foreal, ya see what I'm saying? Ha ha I be"
"Fucking with him all the time, ya know what I mean? I'm saying, I used"

"Man, I would of sold him a Coupe we could of played with,"
"Ya see what I'm sayin'? Yeah, can I get a little hit of that, little nigga with a bigga sack"
See piece of the bigger trap look at that God be rolling on that
Where they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know
Shady Park you heard just don't go
Quick to flip the bird up po'-po'
"Making the way for that rodeo, that rodeo show!"
"Gotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people"
"I gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll, oh no where the beat go?"
"Bring that, shit back, didn't want to hear that, clik-clak"
Tons of fun with guns
Fuck all the lil' chit-chat get back get that get that
"Who knows, who goes there? Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear"
"Stop and stare, pouring out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare"
"Come on, fire! And you know I can't stop 'til I retire!"
"Oh no, we stay swoll, rolling on Vogue tires!"
"Right down the avenue, passing you rapidly stacking"
In the back of the Cadillac and packing emergency action
"Camera, light lights, throwing a punch and then fight fight"
"Packing a lunch and then bite bite, A-T-L stay tight tight I'm just trying to save ya shorty."
I'ma let you know it's real down here.
"When you ride down that two-eighty-five,"
"And you go past Kincaid, get ready to go past that Cambleton Road"

Cause I give her what them girls like [Chorus] [Bridge] [Verse 1: Ludacris]
"Relax and take notes,"
While I'm put you up on game
"Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,"
"But you should grab yourself a seat and a whisky double,"
"Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,"
"They like a little danger and might not admit it,"
"But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,"
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!
"With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,"
"I like open toe straps, but sg talk to em! [Sean Garrett]"

"Yea, we gonna take this to verse 2,"
"Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,"
"Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,"
"So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,"
"Here's a triple black card, it ain't tricking if you got it!"
"Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh,"
"Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,"
"So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,"
"And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!"
"So get loose and slide off your damn garments,"
"Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant"
"There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,"
"So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,"
"And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,"
"They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,"
"And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,"
"Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]"
I know what you feel yes! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]

Lets go! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
Yes! they want what they can! [Ludacris]

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is) [Ludacris]
"Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one"
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
"Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps"
"We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table"
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
"I got games galore, I got game for sure"
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
"Or double it back, I'll double the stacks"
"Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)"
And we can 'bout anything that you want to do
But come up short and oh the things that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
"So hurry up and come get some, if you want some"
"You know the phrase, scared money don't make none! [Chorus] [Ludacris]"
"Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em"
Somebody tell my fam I got a gambling problem
"I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's"
"Drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowing steam"
"Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal"
All my people bring the strength to the block
"Yes sir, I thought you knew it, we loco"
"We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's goin' do it"
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
"Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks"
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
"Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C."
Calling yo' bluff with Puff eating cheesecake
"So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers"
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
"Breaking the whole casino and doing back-flips, man"
"Cameras eying us, sidebetters trying us"
"The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buying us"
"Trying to get me off my grind, but it won't work"
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
"I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em"
"I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em [Chorus: x2] It's 2 am in the morning and it...uhhh...light showers"

All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON

Ran out of liquor

Pack thangs and act strange
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling
Oh no they can't stop
Take it to the floor
Back up and then drop
Effervescent time
Time's of the essence
Make 'em undress in
Less than three seconds
So whores keep steppin'
Whores keep slobbin'
Sex as a weapon
Clothes that I slept in
Streets keep mobbin'
Thieves keep robbin'
Get two in your butt
Three to your noggin'
Creepin' and crawlin'
I'm incogneg'
Can't catch the balls then
You in the wrong league
Let a dog breathe
Watch a pimp walk
Shut yo' as* up when
You hear a pimp talk
Friskier dreams
Krispier Kremes
You lookin' mighty
Fine in them jeans [Chorus:]
All you brothers want a
"Fatty girl, fatty girl"

"Easy, I feel greasy"
When you squeeze me
(Cut de blood claat talk and
Do what ya wan' please me)
I'm talkin' down home
"Smothered in gravy, Cool J be"
Havin' young ladies
Bustin' like three eighties
Lubricated silencers
Crushin' all challengers
Gats that be claimin' they Glocks
But really Dillingers
Get it?
Glock Dillinger
I'm big you small
More nuts on your face
Than graffiti on the wall
Hair like Brillo
Cuttin' up my pillow
Got 'em sayin' (hello)
Naked in a tub of a Jello
Still no competition
Still flow nigga listen
(I'm not supposed to
Do this type of thing
I'm a Christian)
Amen
It's like a scene out
Of Player's magazine
Let them other cats holla
L'll make you scream [Chorus:] Aiyyo
"Welcome home Murray Yo, this is in thought"
Of those broads
Who got the goods
To the chicks who don't
Eh it's still all good
Some broads got an
Automatic thickness for eight
You'll soon get it
Just stay workin' hard at it
Goodness gracious
Good God almighty
You got a badoonka donk
Girl don't hurt nobody
"Toes all painted, feet all out"
It's an aphrodisiac for
The mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky
Gut slappin' ball slappin' cater
To your every fantasy
You got your tongue clitoris tits
And belly pierced
(All that?)
Necklace around yo' waist
"Toe rings, girl do yo' thang"
"I mean, in them jeans"
Yo shape is beautiful
"And I'm ""For you, by you"""
Like FUBU
(B**** you know the name)
Whoo-wee Jesus
JoJo K-Ci and Mary
Girl you don't know
What you do to me
(Lord have mercy)
Ain't no doubt about it
When she walk by
Tongues hang out
Eyes pop out the socket
(Bing)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that
Thang from the front
We gas those up like
Full service
"And, keep 'em drunk"
Like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it
You rock my world
I done died and
Went to heaven
"You got a fatty girl [Chorus:] Okay, I remember the days"
"High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades"
"Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days"
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
"Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial"
"Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?"
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
"When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed"
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
"Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around"
"Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo"
"Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco"
While playboys stepped in talent shows
"Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool"
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school) We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
"Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats"
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
"College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars"
"Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care"
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
"Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet"
"Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say ""sweat"""
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
"Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice"
"Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace"
"Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents"
"No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park We were tryin' so hard"
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
"When we were kids I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat"
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
"Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn"
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
"I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets"
"Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats"
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
"And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man We were tryin' so hard"
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
"When we were kids Yeah, we goin' send this one out"
To everybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
"Let's ride Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]"
"[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]"
"[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Yes, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing changed"
"I'm still pumping 10 kickers, still gripping the grain"
"Still candy in the paint, still riding them things"
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
"Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape"
"Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screaming, ""Gimme a break!"""
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses
"Lamborghini's and Porsche's, Ferrari's and Vipers"
I'ma wipe the seats with you drool then rub the hood with a diaper
"Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank"
"I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank"
"Go strap your seat-belts on, go put your money up"
"Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up"
"Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys"
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys

Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm making sure the slippers is clean
"The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends"
"My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene"
"The chickens just scream, whole crew balling they sick of my team"
"We getting the cream, I'm through hollering, I'm living my dream"
"I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings"
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
"And we looking alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5"
"In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive"
"And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side"
Onlookers and turning heads is all that's seen through his eyes
"I'm breezing on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly"
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side
"And go Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]"
"[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! I'm riding up in, GTO's, and fo'-fo'-two's"

Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl Ludacris
Listen can't get you off my mind
Even if I tried
You're my life
Cross my heart and hope to die
Don't care what people thinking
Don't care what people say
Well make it last for ever
And then make them people pay
Cause all they do is doubt us
But they don't understand
That you're my only women
And I'm your only man
Lets fly away and go somewhere where its 81 degrees
Then jump up on a yacht and sail the 7 seas
Ill climb the highest mountains just to kiss your face
Then put some spice up in your life just to get a taste
Don't nothing feel wrong I'm still gone
And your tip toeing through my mind with your heals on (Get it girl) Chorus

Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl Ludacris
My baby girl and I promise for you I'll do whatever
And I can think of many things that we can do together
Lets go shopping Cause a woman needs options and diamonds and pearls
Then go eat at the finest restaurants around the world
Drink from the finest grapes smoke from the finest leaves
Draped in the finest clothes I wanna put your mind at ease
A full body massage and then let's go catch a movie
Ahh fuck it lets go home and make a movie
Before we can hit the park go find a quiet spot
Then I'll make my body move until your body stops
Cause you know that special spot
It ain't that hard to find
Plus you've been pacing through my mind all the time Chorus
"I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind"
"I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time"
Girl I cant get my mind off youoowhooo

Cause You're my baby girl Damien Marley's Verse
Now baby love you eva prep
And full of class when you a step
Soft supple and delicate
Bumper firm and heavy set
Every muckle a mickle make
"Giggle, chuckle, every breath"
"Every freckle spot, every speck, I say, I say"
Your performance commands respect
And buckle dance than you expect
Nothing lesser than the best
And I'm a loving intellect
Cause I've thought out every step
Every building must erect
Nothing must be incorrect
Nutten mussin get neglect
Could separation separate
That would be inappropriate
There can be no surrogate
For the loving that I get
My cerebellum will not let
Nor allow me to forget
Eva since the day we met
SUGA!! Chorus

Light showers and you're probably hookin' up with that girl
"That's been, two-wayin you all week"
"Her baby daddy's out of town so uhh, you can fuck around"
It's okay to check in that Motel 6
"$59.95, not a cent more for that dirty-ass hoe"
"Yeah, stop by that convenience store and pick up them rubbers"
Magnum I hope
"This is Faizon Love and uhh, I love hoes"

"Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em"

So later on we'll be rollin'
"Drop tops, I'm hittin' yo' hot spots, I'm top notch"
My niggas never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin' game at the A.U.C
Then later on we'd be bonin'
"Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that"
"No wonder why you wakin' up up swollen I'm feelin' you Luda', smokin' my buddha, coochie recruiter"
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
"Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash"
On the back and leave it drippin' down the crack of her ass
"Call me Mr. Magilla-cutty, chasin' booty soft as silly putty"
"Killa for money, still a thug get bump"
"From slow pokin' to locomotion, hittin' bunnies, for threesomes getcha buddy"
"When I'm feelin' scummy I love to cut, 10-4 Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin' the buttons off yo' blouse"
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' house
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south
"Hot fellatio, hot jalapenos, holla while they in yo' mouth"
"So we love that c-c-c-c Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up"
"Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em"
"Get that cut up! Oh-whooo, cut up"
"Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em Now I got the feelin' we can cut the hell out each other"
"And I hope we be the same thang, freaks"
"We can get the mattress goin' 'eh-err, eh-err'"
"Handlin' business while I bang bang, skeet"
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
"I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors"
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
"But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes Come up out yo' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day"
"Cum six times, but it's seven today"

"Ahh, ahh! What's my name?"
So magical I come and touch the game
You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin' but hatin' and a look of disgust
"Always a must, stay ""Adrenaline Rush"""
Wonderin' why they don't be bustin' the same I'm clutchin' my thang
"Stuffin' in it, strokin' it down, beat the stuff up"
"Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it"
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off
I can tell her style by the way that she walks
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
"Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels"
Pullin' rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
"Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag before I tap it"
"I love the chicks that got a lotta ass, so we love that c-c-c-c Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up"
"Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em"
"Get that cut up! Oh-whooo, cut up"
"Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em Bubble, bubble, bubbles is in the bathtub"
Makin' you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin' me thinkin about the bottles that pop
"The models that swallow willin', up under my pillow stayin strapped up"
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin' wrapped up
"Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity"
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin' slapped up I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
"Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head"
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin' Jagged Edge by the bed
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get together
"Because now you gots to ride out, bitch Oh 'Cris, can you do it again, that's what they askin' me"

If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho Now I be riding in my Bentley coupe stuntin' with the top down
Four twenty four inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
Twenty four carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
"Three things you can't take away from me, money, power and respect"
I got it and hold on to it you knew that I never let it go
You prostitute it but money I never let it ho
Speakin' of hoe's oh yes we meet em and we G' 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't want to be 'em dude
"I put my fist up, I got the power girl"
"I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl"
"It's been an hour girl, it's time to go"
And if my neighbor see you while you walking out my door (hey ho)
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho [Chorus] Can't nobody do it like Kim
Only women that can do it like men
V-V-S is be them gems
"(Ho, now count that)"
My money coming in
Bringing them corners on them rims
So play the check book tell me how do you bounce that
I bounce into position like I am vinegar Kama Sutra
"But money make me come, go and ask Luda'"
And women cheat better than men we don't disturb them
"My motto is ""what they don't know won't hurt them"""
"We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched"
"If I'm a ho you's a ho, if I'm a bitch you's a bitch"
Know that I'ma stay rich so fella's do what you do
Cause you don't fuck us niggas we fuck you [Chorus] (Hey ho)

"If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying She likes the night lights, brights lights, big spending"
"Lil Fate been big pimpin', pimpin'"
So don't be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
Cause you know that most you ladies trading sex for money
So if you coming out the pocket then you might get laid
That's how the rent car no the cell phone get paid
I bet the snakes all show once you cut that grass
And I'm a pimp so it's time that I exploit they ass
You see it's hoes after the party it's hoes after the show
"It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll"
"Here's some no dough, no dough, no sleep"
"Ho on your feet, if you don't work you don't eat [Chorus] [Intro: Miguel]"
"I keep dwellin' on the past, babe"
"Know what I need, yeah [Hook: Miguel]"
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
"Some on the fence, some befriended me"
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
"Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt"
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
"Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl"" [Hook: Miguel]"
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
"Need solutions, less problems"
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
"Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em"
"Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em"
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
"But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes [Hook: Miguel]"
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Bridge: Miguel]
"So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby"
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
"Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat"
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Young Jeezy:]
"On 285, I don't know where I'm goin' on 285, I drink when I drive"
"I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin', on 285, on 285, on 285 [x2] [Ludacris:]"
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap move back 45 tucked by my side
"Sip a little bit of this, sip that drink up I'm so drunk when I drive."
"I'm wood grain, grippin' 'n tippin' on some 24's."
I puff the magic dragon & then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell em ain't nothin' change but the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white an I whip it like cocaine
All up an down 285 an I'm goin' around in circles man
My partners call me prince cause they know I got that purple rain
"Burners along my waist belt, gotta put up my pants like I'm urkel man"
My girlfriend said u sure I said bitch I'm for certain man
I'm hurtin' the game so bad they can't keep up when I count this skrilla
My momma quit her job cause I got her workin' with six figures
Yes she's workin' with six figures 'n niggas is workin' like some slaves
She retired a little bit early because her son is fukin paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich an stay alive
And once in awhile just take her Lexus an drive on 285 [Chorus x 2]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
"I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)"
Slappin' a nigga today
"I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)"
Slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today This morning I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work; I'm tired
I hate my nine to five
And I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today
Killin' my boss today
"I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today (it's just a thought, man)"
Killin' my boss today (yeah) Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
"And I'm asking, why did you take him away?"
Why did you take him away?
"I'm asking, why did you take him away? (Why'd you take him?)"
Why did you take him away? (Hey) I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
'Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today (real talk) Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin')
"Callin' up my mobile, cussin' (cussin')"
Always yappin' about this and that
But she really don't be talkin' 'bout nothin'
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it) [Chorus: x2] Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my forty-five
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away?
"When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)"
Stereo's taken away (hey) Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away
Wasting my time away?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it) My grand mama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
'Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (Don't say nothin')
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
"Shit that he has to say (woo) Troops gone, and we still at war (war)"
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
"'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)"
Tomorrow's not promised today
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today
"(Live like today could be your last, man!)"
"Tomorrow's not promised today (hey) [Chorus: x4] Yo hello, Luda"
Whats up boy?

"Northside, northside nigga what?"
"(Northside, northside nigga what?)"
"Southside, southside nigga what?"
"(Southside, southside nigga what?) Good luck, time to get hood stuck"
"Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff"
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
"Last summer, got the hook up"
You know what I did
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
"Type of rat, sat on my ass"
And fiendin' for cash
"Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass"
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
"and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin"
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you whipping yo chin
And I don't blame you
"I lay in the sand, y'all lay in the snow and make angels"
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
"I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier"
"Shady park resident and southside Rider [Chorus] Get back, time to get hood jacked"
"Gold chain, took that"
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what you look at
cause you looking to long
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm getting nutt while I'm singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party
while y'all hitting th bong
But y'all be hitting my schlong
you play the flute quite nicely
"When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty"
"Oh no, you suckers didn't request back up"
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull the gold actor
Get slapped up
Drove up the wall
Put it in Reverse
"you can hope for the best, but expect the worst"
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
"Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny"
It seems as if that's what I need
Filthy south and D's
That's why I roll in from the Southside breeze
Give it to me now [Chorus] Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from the couch to the toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got dis broads acting foolish
And do this for a living
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
"Nightlife running dis streets, it sounds beautiful"
Women break a cuticle
Ballas break bread
"Southside, I represent it till I'm dead"
"What what [Chorus: x2] Turn the lights off I be representin', representin'"
"I be representin', representin' Luda, yeah you representin' for bad bitches all around the world"
The way you put it down in between the sheets is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness When you blow my mind
To the point where all these other women Kinda feelin' like you stole their shine
"So I better come with it,"
"Ha, and I better come split it"
"And I admit that I'm feeling a little pressure, when you're telling me I better come get it"
Ha but I'm the man for the job
Can't nobody do it quite like I do
"And the same go for you, we a match made in heaven, Ima stand right by you"
Why you saying? Just wanna keep all your attention baby
"Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey"
"It turns me on to know I turn you on, yeah OK, OK, OK"
Hey can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy
"Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey"
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
"Hm you do that and you gonna learn today, hey"
"I'll be representin'(Get on that thang), representing (Get on that thang),"
(Get on that thang and represent)
"I be representin', (Get on that thang) representin' , (Get on that thang, get on that thang)"
"Watch how I put it down Put it down like ay,"
Only know you can do it
Then I'ma hit every single one of your spots and really you don't need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
When I'm askin' if this' minds
"Ima be a motivation just you just tryna see if you can break my fucking spine,"
"I'm so attracted, to the way you carry yourself and keep your composures"
You a lady in the street but behind closed doors you're a fucking soldier
A brother will never know
"That's how you like it ha,"
"Bet that booty pack a mean punch and Ima spike it, huh Why you saying"
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
"Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey"
"It turns me on to know I turn you on, yeah"
"OK, OK, OK"
Hey can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy
"Yeah, alright, alright, alright,"
Hey sit in the front row and watch me perform
"Hm you do that and you gonna learn today,"
"I'll be representin'(Get on that thang), representin' (Get on that thang),"
(Get on that thang and represent)
"I'll be representin', (Get on that thang) representin' , (Get on that thang, get on that thang)"
"Watch how I put it down You're incredible, edible, unforgettable"
"Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause"
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to I'll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it's not that many
You give me that good and plenty And I walk around all day grinin'
My mind and body are gone
That JJ so so sublime
"Throw it in the air and turn it to sunshine, you make me wanna call the crib"
"And say I'm never coming home, Luda! Why you sayin'"
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
"Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey"
"It turns me on to know I turn you on, yeah"
"OK, OK, OK hey"
"Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy,"
"Ey yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey"

"Hmm you do that and you gonna learn today, hey I'll be representin'(Get on that thang), representing (Get on that thang),"
(Get on that thang and represent)
"I'll be representing, (Get on that thang) representing , (Get on that thang, get on that thang)"
Watch how I put it down
"I be representin', I be representin' (I'm representin')"
I be representin' I be representin' (I'm representin')
Watch how I put it down When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
"Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life"
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
"But not at my expense, I did all I could do"
"You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool"
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
"But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia"
Too many emotions I try to bury
"But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry"
"And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama"
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
"Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together"
"Forget about the past, now's a better time than never"
"Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions"
"So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges"
You little bitches When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
"Or give me one more reason to go Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters"
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
"In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship"
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
"But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall"
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
"My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavors?"
"Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?"
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
"So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?"
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
"That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon"
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
"And then, trillion When all your love is lost"
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
"For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle"
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
"Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out"
"Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out"
"These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out"
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap then starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
"But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends, let the story begin The grass is always greener on the other side"
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away [Gucci mane]
"Hey how you doin, Ms. Lady? You so fine with it"
"I know you handlin business, can I get your 5 minutes?"
Dont be offended by me telling you you thick with it
"Wit all that shake, can a player get some fries with it?"
"Wit all that shake, can a player get some fries with it?"

That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
"She a stallion, no horseshit"
You could fit that bitchs booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
"I put my balls on the table, tell her rack em up"
"Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way"
"Sprinkle my nuts on top what a sundae, hey"
Whipped cream cherry on top
"And when I aint wit her, p-ssy on lock"
"Throw away the key, its a rap bitch!"
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich [Hook] [Gucci Mane]
"Yo, mama turned out, she so popular"
You suckers cant see her with binoculars
Shell suck your pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Dont try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type that chickll scratch you up
"Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, Shes dangerous"
Her old man used to snort angel dust
"So, dont be quick to judge, shorty bad as f-ck"
Shes the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she f-cked him up
"He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner"
Its Gucci [Hook] [Ludacris]
Ive got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be f-ckin while you niggas out on hot dates
You all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her
These hoes be sprintin like its track n field
Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
"Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound p-ssy, yes!"
Its Ludacris Mr. Slay-A-Bitch
Unless that p-ssy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
"Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket"
And niggas talking shit I bust em in their chicken nugget [Hook] When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)

"Hustle till I ball (ball), get money till I die (Die)"
These haters want my paper and the snakes is out to get me
So when I leave this bitch I'm taking everything with me
With my wrist glowing and my fist throwing
And my Lamborghini Aventador sneak it on the block
"Been going and I been flowing I gotta say that Ludacris, a nigga never gonna stop"
Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
Neighborhood call me the plug of the plug
Poppin' a pill and then jump in the tub
"We buy out the bar, we buy out the club"
"Got a black, AMX, I left home, no Visa"
"Talk money, and my money, talk back, like Caesar"
"Mix soda, with the syrup, we be leaning like the Tower of Pisa"
"And if y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all either I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)"

"Ah shit I'm talking 1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4"
How many shots to hit the motherfucking floor
"You sipping man, quit tripping man, stop acting like a ho"
Waitress said another round? I said you already know You see I started from nothing and made it up outta the hood
Dollar and a dream and I made what I could
"Fifty to a hundred, then a hundred to a grand"
"Then a grand to a milli, nigga really what's good"
It's wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
Neighbor's all think that I cook rocks
No peace in the streets
Really got me thinking ain't no such thing as a good cop
My neck froze and no ice steel
"Flows, rappers just bite still"
"Platinum plaques, three Grammy's"
I tell you I Made It like Mike Will
With coupes all on that freeway
Pockets on Gabby Sidibe
Got cake and women blowing like everyday is my b-day We be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)

Ah shit

"Ah shit She dragging a mink coat, got Peter pissed, it's a pity"
A titan like Tennessee but she chiefing like Kansas City
She love it when she get tipsy and strip to the core essentials
With her legs sprawled out like the Air Jordan symbol
She be twenty thousand feet in my apartment in the sky
"Y'all hoes just drink and drive, my woman just drink and fly"
She a lady in the street ain't nothing fake about her booty
"She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty She be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)"

In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
"Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop"
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em

And the tell me what's they fantasy

"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the bath tub"
With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
"What's my name, what's my name, what's my name"
"Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie"
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
"Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up"
"That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert"
"Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt"
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
"Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid"
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
"Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes"
"On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes"
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
"Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt"
"Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs"
"Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes"
"And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'"
"Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave"
"But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I want to (Diamond in the back)"

Wonderin' how I can get me some
"My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch"
"So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum"
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
"But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes"
"And I was always reached for the sky, I don't know why"
I'ma little bitty kid wit' a whole bunch of gangsta wishes
"When I grow up, you just wait, I'ma be so straight"
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
"No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters"
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
"I'ma have it made in the shade, I'ma be so paid"
"And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills"
"Matter fact I'm schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good"
When I ditch these trainin' wheels I want to (Diamond in the back)

"I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation"
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
"I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes"
In order to get myself some dollar bills
"It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box"
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
"And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss"
My older cousin need some cheddar too
"He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick"
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
"And whatever they do, don't let the owner know"
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
"And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want"
I'ma tell him I wanna I want to (Diamond in the back)
I want to (Sunroof top)

And I want to (Sunroof top)

"For goodness sakes, I'm just a kid"
"Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'"
Like there no remorse for what I did
"Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets"
"How some just creep, really just to eat a meal"
"I could of swore it was mine, what I used to tell the po-pos"
What I left to rob and steal
"Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'"
Find somethin' I love to do
"Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'"
"Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw"
"Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls"
I'm adjustin' to my environment
"This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back"
Why can't work feel like retirement? I want to (Diamond in the back)
I want to (Sunroof top)
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)

"I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta I got five kisses where you want 'em at"
"Either one on your lips,"
"Your ear, your neck, your stomach, or your back."
"Your inner thigh, right on your knee cap or your belly button."
"These other guys be out here talkin' but they steady frontin',"
They don't know what they want that's why I tell you put your trust in me.
"Share all your secrets, all your desires and your fantasies."
"I ain't gon' tell nobody, baby I'm an only child."
"I'd keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile,"
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to ain't that what you want?
"I'll be your lover, your provider, and your confidant."
"And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect,"
But you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it.
"I wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in,"
"We could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when,"
"You like it rough I give it rough and I start to pull your hair,"
"Cause ecstasy's your destination and I'ma take you there,"
"Tell me a secret baby Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows,"
And think about it just as soon as the door close.
"Tell me a secret baby,"
Tell tell tell me a secret baby.
Show me somethin' that nobody else sees.
"Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,"
Tell me a secret baby.
"Tell tell tell me a secret baby And there ain't nobody in the universe that competes with you,"
Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do.
"Blind folded,"
"Handcuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name,"
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game.
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be.
"And I got just what you want baby girl you want it,"
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off.
Just give me your body its guaranteed that I'ma
"Break you off, off, off, off, off until the sun rise,"
And I'm not here to disappoint just give me one try.
"One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,"
"But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,"
"Ne-Yo holla at 'em. Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows,"
And think about it just as soon as the door close.
"Tell me a secret baby,"
Tell tell tell me a secret baby.
Show me somethin' that nobody else sees.
"Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,"
Tell me a secret baby.
"Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby So we can talk about your fantasies,"
"And ain't nobody gotta know but me,"
"Baby come on and make this move if you gonna,"
"Baby we grown we can do what we wanna,"
"Said you can tell me what you like to do,"
"Baby girl you never know I may like it to,"
"Baby come on and make this move if you gonna,"
"Baby we grown we can do what we wanna,"
"Aye. Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows,"
And think about it just as soon as the door closes.
"Tell me a secret baby,"
"Tell tell, tell me a secret baby."
Show me somethin' that nobody else sees.
"Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,"
Tell me a secret baby.
"Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby Whoa whoa whoa"
Whoa whoa whoa
Tell me a secret
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa Wake uuuuuuuup
I see the sun shine gazing threw window pain
Blazing like indo flame its time to wake up
Co0me to ur senses manye
Snow is all around you
But you dont play no winter games
Cartrage all around you
But you dont play netendo games
Load them up and fill them up to the top
Before you cocking them
Trying to get from the botton to the top
Like the stock exchange
See I was shitting shaving
Hit the coner for a block exchange
Amazing what my people would do
For some pocket change
But maybe this aint the life you choose
This is the life you stay strapped and pack a knife
Or end up with a bloody nose
Street survival or survival of the street
And only the strong survive
There's no survival for the weak
Catch a sneak eak at death if ur not on ur p's & q's
They carry banana clip and niggas will peel u for ur shoes
This is the blues but not all hill street
U can call it kill or be killed street
Lost a pint of blood let it spill street
Stop and wake uuuuuuuuuup
Wake uuuuuuuuuup They say my folkes would do any thing for the fortune and fame
And it will take a fortune to get rid of all the pain
But im saying use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
You say the only family u got is in the game
And the only way to make is by sell cocain
But im say use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
"Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya) Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy"
"And I'm close to the edge, so yo' parents can come push me"
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
"I got kids ""Actin' a Fool"" from the traps to the burbs My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque"
So I shot the tooth fairy and took my old teeth back
"I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater"
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
"But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin"
"I go fishin' on my lake, with yo' bitch as the bait"
"Plus I eat many MC's, but I don't gain no weight The number one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers"
"I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas"
"But my trick ain't for kids, if you dig 'em, you'll get smacked"
"I'll clock ya, I'll spring forward, you fall back Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers"
"That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers"
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
"To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with Rastas"
"For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas"
I own so many jerseys I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
"'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass"
The competition never just want to admit that they lost
"And that they last about as long as my part in the wash From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit' you"
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
"I'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee"
They may the mold of the penis enlarger off me
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
"Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq So yippie-kay-yay, yippie-yie-yie-yo"
"If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro"
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons So wash all ya sins away and stop playin'
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him
"Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet"
"And when I'm drunk tell them kids, ""Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?"" Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico"
"Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot"
"And people think I'm bad, they say ""Oooh he's so evil!"""
"'Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf"
"I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself"
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
"Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them"
'Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it
"And yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellent I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see"
"And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me"
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
"So I'm a trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump"
"y'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months"
Take a look at yo' life and no wonder you so sad
"Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool! So I'm just sitting in this rehab class"
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question
Like Ludacris are you over there sexting

"A what, a new tattoo wow,"

"Stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP"
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that you I see

"Jiggle it baby, jiggle it baby It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? I'm still back for the first damn time"
So grab a hold of your seats while I open your mind
And take you back to when I dropped down from heaven
And I came out my moms and had a mic as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you'd see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first rhyme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pastimes
Every where that I went spitting and babbling
"Showing my ass, growing up then started traveling"
"From one city to the next, Luda landed in the ATL"
Where the pimps and the players dwell
"I made a tape, did shows and got exposure"
And kept learning as my black ass got older
No matter what I just kept at my trade
"I made mistakes but stayed sharper then a Ginsu blade It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age fourteen, my talent show a beast outta cage"
I would of won but disqualified for jumping off stage
"But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms"
When I was at Banneker High School pulling fire alarms
"So I could get a crowd around me, make a name for my block"
"People told me ""keep flowing,"" they ain't want me to stop"
Was back when Big Nose John was my human beat box
"We'd skip school, hit open campus and watch out for street cops"
Now I'm known around the town as that nigga that raps
From the hills that made high to them G roll traps
"And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft"
"And some said I wouldn't make it, they would giggle and laugh"
So I picked up a couple books by Donald Goins
"Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins"
"Before the age of eighteen, I was destined to make it"
"My bank account read Disturbing The Peace, incorporated It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age eighteen, I'm strugglin', just to survive"
But got a gig workin' for change at 97.5
"Now I'm rapping on the radio, increasing their numbers"
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
Late nights I'm in they studio and using they tools
Me and Puma smoking weed and breaking all of their rules
"And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs"
But nobody did shit and they was taking too long
"So three years went past, and I saved enough cash"
To make my own record label and put myself on blast
"The album was independent, it was just for the streets"
I sold a one thousand copies in my first fuckin' week
"Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand"
"All the record companies bite me, but I chose Def Jam"
And the main reason that I made it and I love the A-town
"Was 'cause the block had its eye brows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets"
"Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets"
So please pay attention when you're coming around
"'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go"
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby
"Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go"
"Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now Check it"
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
"You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health"
"See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself"
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
"You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs"
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
"Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail"
"I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper"
"And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers"
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
Word of Mouf time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass These rap cats is soft like R&B; singers
"It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers"
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
"Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come"
"Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking"
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
"Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade"
"You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?"
"Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher"
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
"I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes"
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
"Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash"
"Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky"
"System on blast, cops just pass"
"Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky Grease don't pop on the stove no more, moved on up"
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
"Should I wild out, what the fuck?"
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like afro-sheen
But they don't never really wanna pop them things
"Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go"
"And I stop at a light, pull off so slow"
"But I'm out for the night, so pass that dro"
"So, daddy come home in a Cadillac brome, Cadillac brome"
Now don't it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
"Trick car alarms, then bend them curves"
"Chop chop, chunk it up fat man herb I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash"
"Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky"

"Sticky, icky, icky, icky"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky It's illegal but the plants in my backyard grow, that's my bud"
"Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck"
"Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, nigga what?"
"Act like I don't make cloud, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?"
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
"But, I guess what you don't really know don't hurt"
"With a vest, and a pump hear the shotgun squirt"
"My folks on the block, man, they got that work (they got that work)"
"Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood"
"Protect your chest, they up to no good"
"And come through flossing, they wish y'all would I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash"

"Sticky, icky, icky, icky"
"Sticky, icky, icky, icky Worldwide hustlers get that dough"
"Work that tip, get rid of evidence, move that brick"
Keep a D eagle with an extra clip
"Think it ain't so, suck a dick!"
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
"Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on back!"
"Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze"
"With a mac, with a glock I'ma make 'em say please"
"In the back, on the block so the cops they freeze"
"And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?"
Don't it smell so sweet?
"In Decatur, where they pack that heat"
"And rob neighbors in the night creep, creep"
"I'll see you later we'll be in them streets I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash"

"Head down, pussy pussy popping"
"Head down, pussy pussy popping"
"Head down, pussy popping on a handstand On a handstand"
On my American bandstands
"Summer-salts, cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing"
Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick-dick getting out of control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it drop
"Tuck and twist if you don't like it, you're fuckin' Cris"
I'm rubbing clits so stay and catch don't try to duck and miss
Do your stretches don't pull no hamstrings
"You got me moving, in fact you doing the damn thing"
Stronger muscles exercise every part of your body hurts
"Let's do this sweating, thank God your bath and body works"
"I like a woman that makes her own doe, don't need a lot of help"
But your heart'll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt
"Lip gloss traces, your pierced in 11 places"
"And your lips downtown just made some familiar faces like whoa! Head down, pussy pussy popping"
"Head down, pussy pussy popping"

"Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Add a chapter to this pussy popping legacy"
"Trying ta be that bitch, can't no bitch come fuck wit me"
When I pop that Cris I'm only business and bubbly
When I'm in the 6 wit 20's spinning I'm luxury
'Cause I got that head game
Fuckin' up that bed frame
"But don't get me wrong, shawty gon' let that lead aim"
Better learn that game shawty
Better get your man shawty
'Fore he end up tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty
This here be futuristic
This business so explicit
"The way I break it down for you bitches, it's so explicit"
"Let it go now front, back, watch me drop it like that"
Show me where the money at
Boy come wit them hunnid stacks
Breakin' wit that pussy popping

We at least 50 deep
"Smokin' purple, potent, green shit got everybody geeked"
"In the club 7 days a week, find DTP up in this beesh"
"That ho popping, dropping, Goddamn shawty who is this?"
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
"I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money"
"And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me"
"A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was ""Strawberry"""
"Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'"
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'
"Here, you deserve this doe. Now jump on stage and work a pole"
"Face down, ass up hoe, hands on poles"
"Now pop that coochie, you know the procedure"

"Head down, pussy pussy popping"
"Head down, pussy pussy popping"
"Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Head down, pussy pussy popping"

"Head down, pussy popping on a handstand [Chorus: x3]"
"Go to sleep, hoe to sleep, go to sleep, hoe to sleep"
"If you're tired be quiet and go to sleep, hoe to sleep Man, I tell a hoe to go to sleep (go to sleep)"
"They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep"
'cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense
"Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical con-tent"
Then about where your time spent
"Mess around get your guys hit, a ten hut!"
"I send three-six ol' shit, nigga what?"
"If ya tired ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose"
"But'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or hell you would Nigga I got shotty's and semi's, I love 'dro and henne' ?"
"All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many"
"I got qp's and halves, if we beefin' I blast"
"You sleepin' I laugh, ask 'cris, I'm off the rip"
"I had this hoe who talked too much, I had to off the bitch"

"So, lay down bitch, gimme all that you dreamed for"
"Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi"
"It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi"
"Them god damn toys, do you know what I mean, boi? Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them three-six niggas"
"This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga"
Or bustin' massive 'round some s.k.
My last trip to a-t-l I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'm a ball fucker with a limp
"They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp"
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
"We memphis niggas [Chorus: x4] North, north, south, south, westwood, orange mouth"
"Nigga we be smokin' life, never shut ya charlie brown"
"Memphis niggas in this bitch, pockets full, ya know we bail"
"Hooked up with my nigga 'cris, then we head to a-t-l"
"Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, ""fuck you hoe!"""
"Nigga rollin' up the moe, as long that white shit up they nose"
"Mayn this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around"
"Juicy j be high as fuck, catch me in the lost and found Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for"
"And up, get yaself in this clique"
"Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut"
"Look, I'm from gittero what?"
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
"Ass in, ain't no askin', it's no tolerance as long bitch check in"
"She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting"
So abide by the call of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
? gonna creep in ya home while you gone
Have you comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets [Chorus: x4] I'm never goin' nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
"Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy"
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
"Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly"
"Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey"
"Drove through the window, the industry super sized me"
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
"I'm on the rise, so many people despise me"
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T
"You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)"
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
"Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)"

"Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)"
"I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)"
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
"I'm comin' for that number one spot! Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada"
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
"If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla"
"In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha"
"Father, father, and hey I love gold"
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
"Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold"
"Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled"
"A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake"
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
"I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my ""Eye Candy"""
"Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar"
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)

"Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)"

Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
"I'm comin' for that number one spot! Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master"
"Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards"
These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
"They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!"""
"Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo"
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
"Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls"
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
"Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)"

Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
"I'm comin' for that number one spot! Girl, we might has well see what's up wit these niggas"
"Hello, Hello, Yeah, what's, oh, oh, what's up? Hey"
"Yo, this is 20/20, hey, hey, Cris, Cris"

"What?, Range Rover, all black, hell, yea Shit, now, We like right next door an' shit in this hud house"
"Yea the door kinda fucked up so you're gonna have to, uh"
"Climb through the window, is that cool?"
"What the fuck? Hell, no, nigga Hey, yeah! I want all you proud sisters to stand up"
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Brothers and Sisters if you know you got your thing together
"I want you to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'"
"I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together"
"So come on now and get up to it y'all The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows"
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cause the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independent women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dogs pullin' triggers
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
"East coast, west coast, mid west, dirty south"
Then we took it all around the world
"I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls"
"Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,"
"Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode"
"Hip hop, R&B;, Pop-tart, what you want?"
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
"The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal Cause they can't get what I got's"
"They want it so bad, four million dollar pad"
"And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!"
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
"They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time"
And I'm about to make 'em choke
"Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach"
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon) Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
"Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?"
"While he doin' shows, I'm in these streets, know what I'm sayin'?"
"While he on tv, I'm in these streets"
"And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it"
"Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear"
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
"I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National"
"I got my own record label, you heard of us"
"The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real"
"Who this nigga thing he is? I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times"
"I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs"
"So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk"
"And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk"
"Oh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops"
People in the way want to baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
"If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick"
"I tried to tell 'em, but they don't want to listen"
"I tried to shine 'em, but they don't want to glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'"
"And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools"
"Cause rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules"
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
"Hear what they playin', 'cause through this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead"
"Call ya' producers, 'cause I'm hurtin' these beats"

"Later we'll screw and slow it up If you make it fast, I can make it last"
And I'm a nigga that's makin' cash
Eight figures in the bank and I pull yo rank

"I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit you hoes ain't used ta"
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
Ay what you call that? I call it Cleveland
Now nigga! [Chorus:Repeat x7] I know everybody remember their first time
No matter how old you are
You gotta remember that very first time you did something man Ain't nothing like the first time
"remembering the memories (I remember, I remember)"
Ain't nothing like the first time (ok)
or how things used to be (how they used to be girl)
Ain't nothing like the first time (hey mom I'm coming in I won't be too late)
remembering the memories(the green lights come on)
Ain't nothing like the first time (I gotta have your ass home)
"or how things used to be Ok, come travel with me down memory lane"
Back in my wonder years when nobody considered me sane
First time I got a whooping 'sRight where I begin
Cuz what I did I told my mom I'd never do it again
Round four years old and young Luda's a menace (yep)
But I cried the first time I had to go to the dentist
"Cuz I was scared then a mug, I couldn't stand no doctors"
But I loved getting drunk my first time off vodka (oh yeah)
'Til the very next morning I was hung on over (uh huh)
Proceeded to throw upon my grandma's sofa
"It was nasty, I swore I wouldn't take another sip"
The first time getting high I had to take another hit
It wasn't working at first then I started tweaking
Back seat of my boy's ride just laughing for no reason
"Been rappin' since I was seve, I remember the time"
Plus I wrote my first son when I was nine
And ain't nothing like the first time Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
"or how things used to be Oh, you gotta go, you gotta get your ass out"
"Cuz im my momma come home, well she's likely to pass out man"
That's what I said about my bust my first nuts
Cuz all through grade school we tried to bust the first slut
"That we could geto our hands on, sex never last long"
After sixty seconds tell that trick to put her pants on
"It smell like badussy, and I don't like that"
I'm about to call her four eyes and I'll be right back Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be I got memories in the corner of my mind
"Misty watered colored memories, thinking bout the first time"
That I learned how to ride my bike
And the first time I got into a fight
Or it could have been the first time
I got my heart broke by this girl I like
My first time to Atlanta was my first time on a plane
My first time on ecstacy I stood out in the rain
My first time getting grain I was in the backseat of Rudy car
"The first time I stole was a sky box, basketball cards, and a candy bar"
"The first time I heard the legend, we robbed the dope boy"
We got about thirty grand out
I was fifteen years old and in high school
And I had to tall Willy every look stand out
"First everything, home brewing, bitch swing"
Like Micheal when he won his first championship ring
"And he cried with the trophy, that's like my first rhyme"
First check for rapping on back for the first time
"First met Quincy Jones, he said I looked like Snoop"
I remember when me and Chris were in a group Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be And I had to tell Willy every look stand out 
They call me Mr Carter I kissed the daughter
Of the deads forehead I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers
Gracias Im crazy yes its obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust
I aint sniffin Im just pitchin ya honor I aint snitchin ya honor
Hate bitch niXgas bitches with power
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young tryin to hustle my dough
Tryin to tell the old junkies that my crack aint soap
Tryin to tell you fool you chump that my mack aint broke
You aint tryin to see how far that black back lane go
No call me Pacman you ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue
Jewelry usually Im a hooligan for the money

Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real niXga business then you niXgas unemployed
Jumped on the celly called Machiavelli
He says he was gravy I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror said Yous an ill niXga
Then I ran to the money like track and field niXga
Now I think Ill have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of asskissers and dick pullers
Im tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
Im shooting for the stars astronauts dodge bullets

The haters music to my ears I got my dancin shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I dont give a fuck Avenue

Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks I just enjoy the head
Im so sick of these niXgas I need meds
Smoking on a hallelujah thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R Im a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass and everybodys looking
But how can you get the picture if you dont know who took it
This current affairs but who the hell cares
Everybodys fighting over positions musical chairs
On the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs
Im just fucking ready so I come prepared yeah
I know your name yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion damn
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise we dont know that its there
And I see you with your palms in your pants
But me me see me I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger Im a critical thinker

VerseLittle Brother
How many ways can I say Im done fishin

Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food foreign cars many women
And some say its the life I was given
I say it dont matter if I work at McEDs
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but whats done is done
Women steppin out for love men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star thats will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun one
Chorus x Lil Brother First Lil Wayne Second
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go

VerseLil Brother
We was high school sweethearts talkin since we was teens

Word get back to wifey she like Stop the song
Im takin the kids to my mommas Im out Im gone
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears
But Ive been with your daddy for boutyears
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I aint never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I aint sayin that its right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest and I aint tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record
But you should know by now that all niXgas is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard
Chorus x
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart
VerseLil Wayne
I say I dont have nothin if I dont have you
Like Shadai we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I dont want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey girl dont play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you dont want to leave me believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv
Its young weezy I know what ya thought
But Im just here to play my part so dont go breakin my heart
Chorus x Lil Wayne First Lil Brother Second
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go

And when your not good then your arrogance is funny
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Hearing through the grapevine niXgas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift man you better be Peyton

Straight frowns no daps strapped three times

Tell them pussy niXgas come together
Happy better niXga niXga super soaker wetter niXga
Six feet under flowers you aint nothing but a petal niXga
Im just a little niXga trying to be a civil niXga
Thirty years old shit thatll be a giving niXga
Quit it Wayne your Mom is listening
But she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in
Them niXgas tripping until the shots whistling
Hear them bullets sizzle like a cobra at attention
I gotta bitch and quit calling women bitches
As long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind I gotta get it
Im admitted to the game true playa no quitting
There you go shitting on a way a niXga thanking
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
This is the future aint promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Train in the tidal wave this is the ocean
Stand in the heat til the mother fucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless rats and roaches
Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune
Come and get it automatics in motion
We banging for the bread niXga even the molded
I got my loaf I got my toast
Chaperon of the south I got my coast yea
And until I die Im the the the the the best rapper alive
Im mac maine and this young money you betta em
Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Done what i shouldnt did but they said i couldnt

Give them niXgas something ta them bitches smelling like money after full
court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a full course dinner
Young money cash money throw pifatti at the winner
And yet he understund us when we told him break it off
Cause gangstas talk one word will be a wall
Alone with two cant handle this destructin

Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every ripcas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night shell flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when Im pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin Im Tyson and shit
But Im a man so Im here to handle my situtions correctly
And i noI might be dumb but niXgas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner Im fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like im livin happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke aboutblunts
and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
just so I get through the stuff but I be like
Chorus x
Ahhhh man its complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man
Im gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN
Verse
I try to keep my head up but I die to keep my bread up
And usually Im fed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And i get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me its tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And Im walkin on the edge stuck without a solution
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I dont need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it
Cas yall cats dont really no me yall jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I aint neva said they dont appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasnt a man I wouldnt make it through
Chorus x
Verse
Who would have known that this was somthin that didnt turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
Im influenced and effected by the way it became
And I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
Im always street so Ill forever be facin a change
And Ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then Im waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And Im so often Im congratulated for the succeced at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didnt ask for you to like me I dont care if you hate me
But dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell Im gone
And I dawg I do believe Im grown
so Ill be good on my own but I be like
Chorus fadingBelieve Dat
Lil Wayne
Chea whats up baby

I aint tryin to hurt you only if you want me to ha
Yea somethin like that
Yea wats happenin baby Im lil wayne from new orleans
Fresh out the navy now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine
Banish from the scene
God damnit Im so manish
Handle it like a standard
So put ur panties and ur pants by the trashcan
Romance on the floor plans
Yea we hold hands while we rollin
Jus tryin to keep up with the program
Jus tryin to sneak up on ya
Like how you doin mam
Im a old soul in a young man
We got to it and we didnt stop till the birds hit the block
And she aint neva had it like that
Chorus
Girl you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here girl tonight
So I can get my grown man on with you
You dont kno about it Im on my grown man x
Currency
Now I dont really hit the club
But tonight Ill make an exception
For some reason I cant seem to keep my eyes out your direction
Im lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn
I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier
Young man young money with the money long
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown
And ur perception of me is so wrong
Dont worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved
And you dont rock like them I can see it in your eyes
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise
cause tonight you lookin like ms right
And I swore to be a player for life but Ill change for you
Chorus
Lil wayne

Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
Were apart and away
And it feels so stray
Nge wouldnt you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could
Do it again x
Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
Do it again
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But imma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then Ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didnt do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
Do it again x
Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And Im just wishin
We could
Do it again x

And Im in it like Bennett hoe arent I cool

Like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Bitch Im Mack Maine
I got tha heart of a king blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before my second time to the grave
But its one life to live thats why Im gettin paid
Off a flow thats priceless I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise
Blaze as I gaze at the stars and ask the lord
Why the culprit at the pall pit
It make me sick to my stomach
Thats why I rap like a pregnant woman I dont spit I vomit
So pay homage me and wayne two Gs
Like twenty hundreds
And we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothas from anotha
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something
Thats a hint to you David
Throwin shots at Goliath
'This the new testament where the victor is tha giant
So you should get your way and lose the hate
Remember males shouldnt be jealous thats a females trait
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
You ever want something 
that you know you shouldn't have 
"The more you know you shouldn't have it, "
The more you want it 
"And then one day you get it, "
It's so good too 
But it's just like my girl 
When she's around me 
"I just feel so good, so good "
"But right now I just feel cold, so cold "
Right down to my bones 
'Cause ooh... 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long 
Anytime she goes away 
Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away 
"I know, I know, I know, I know, "
"I know, know, know, know, know, "
"I know, I know, "
Hey I ought to leave 
I ought to leave her alone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness every day 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
[Chorus:]
"I wanna, wanna be where you are"
Anywhere you are
"I wanna, wanna be where you are"
Everywhere you are
[Bridge:]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
[Chorus:]
"I wanna, wanna be where you are"
"Any, any, anywhere you are"
"I wanna, wanna be where you are"
I gotta be where you are
Oooh
"Foolish of me, I couldn't see "
The forest for the trees 
You've been so true 
I've been so cruel to you 
"Oh, girl please don't leave me"
[Chorus:]
If you stay I'll find a way 
To erase the past 
Baby don't leave me 
Girl don't take your love from me 
Oh girl 
What can I say to make you stay 
"Baby, don't leave me "
You've been so kind 
It blows my mind to know
"Oh girl, I really hurt you "
[Chorus:]
"Tell me girl, it's not to late "
And you give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Girl don't take your love 
Don't take your love 
[Bridge:]
"Girl, if you take your love away from me "
I'm gonna be in misery 
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
How will I make it when it's gone 
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
...I really wanted to do
"Girl , this time..."
"Ooh, oh girl I really mean it "
[Chorus:]
"So tell me girl, it's not too late "
And you'll give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
"Don't take your love, no no no no no"
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl 
Don't take your love from me 
"Baby, don't take your love from me "
Don't take your love from me 
"Oooh, don't take your love from me "
"Baby, don't take your love from me"
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way
Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way
In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
"Because we love, I know"
We care enough
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way
Just a little time is all it takes
"What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see"
Love is all we need
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way
"Got to be there, got to be there "
In the morning 
When she says hello to the world 
"Got to be there, got to be there "
Bring her good times 
And show her that she's my girl 
Oh what a feeling there'll be 
The moment I know she loves me 
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
I need her sharing her world beside me 
So I've got to be there 
Got to be there in the morning 
And welcome her into my world 
And show her that she is my girl 
"When she says, ""Hello world!"" "
I need her sharing the world beside me 
That's why I've got to be there 
Got to be there where love begins 
And that's everywhere she goes 
I've got to be there so she knows 
"That when she's with me, she's home "
Got to be there 
Got to be there
He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 
[Chorus:]
"Rockin' robin, rock rock"
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 
"Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee "
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
"The wise old owl, the big black crow "
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 
[Chorus]
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 
They started going steady and bless my soul 
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 
He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 
[Chorus]
When this old world gets you down 
When your spirit's on the ground 
Just remember I will always be around 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
When you're feeling all alone 
Like a child who's got no home 
You know you've always got a place where you can go 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 
'Til you break those ties that bind 
'Til that day you're really mine 
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 
We've got rainbows yet to find 
And we'll find them all in time 
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
Yes remember I will always be around 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
Maria hey hey Maria

Oh baby you keep a-running away 
Oh baby yeah Maria 
I need you honey 
Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower 
Oh hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me Maria 
If you're on that lonely night 
What's my life without you girl 
I'm so lonely I'm so blue 
Without you darling my life is through 
Come on back
Love is here
"And oh my darling, now you're gone"
Love is here
"And oh my darling, now you're gone"
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there
[Spoken:]
"You closed the door to your heart, girl"
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here
"And oh my darling, now you're gone"
You made me love you
"And oh my darling, now you're gone"
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away
[Spoken:]
You stripped me of my dreams
"You gave me faith, then you took my hope"
Look at me now
Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
[Spoken:]
My heart cries out for your tuch
"But baby, you're not there"
And the lonely cry fades in the air
Love is here
"And oh my darling, now you're gone"
Love is here
"And oh my darling, now you're gone"
You made me love you
"Oh oh my darling, now you're gone"
"Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,"
"Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone"
When you're down and trubled 
And you need some love and care 
"And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right "
Just close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I'll be there to brighten up 
"Yeah, even your darkest night "
You just call out my name 
"And you know, wherever I am "
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 
[Chorus:]
"Winter, spring, summer or fall "
All you have to do is call 
"And I'll be there, yeah I will "
You've got a friend 
When the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old north wind 
He begins to blow 
Here's what you do baby 
Keep your head together 
And call my name out loud 
And soon you'll hear me 
Knockin' at your door 
"Oh yes I will, yes I will "
You just call out my name 
"And you know, wherever I am "
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 
[Chorus]
Ain't it good to know 
That you've got a friend 
People can be so cold 
They'll hurt you and desert you 
And take your soul if you let them 
"Oh, don't let them "
[Chorus:]
"Winter, spring, summer or fall "
All you have to do is call 
"And I'll be there, yes I will "
"You've got a friend, yes you do "
"You've got a friend, yes you do "
"Right till the end, for you "
Ain't it good to know
"Ben, the two of us need look no more"
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me) 
"Ben, you're always running here and there"
(Here and there) 
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere) 
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go) 
"I used to say ""I"" and ""me"""
"Now it's ""us"", now it's ""we"""
"I used to say ""I"" and ""me"""
"Now it's ""us"", now it's ""we"""
"Ben, most people would turn you away"
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben 
(A friend) 
Like Ben
(Like Ben) 
Like Ben
Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see

With A Child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
"Take life easy, so easy nice and easy"
Like a child so gay and so carefree
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me down
Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed my side
You make the sun shine
[Refrain]
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you
This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time
[Refrain]
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
"When all the things you are, are mine"
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
"Some, some, some, some, day "
My happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
"When all the things you are, are mine"
"yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine"
"all the things you are, got to be mine"
"Some day you are, are mine"
"all the things you are, got to be mine"
"all the things you are, got to be mine"

Sadness had been close as my next of kin
"Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away"
My life began when Happy smiled
"Sweet, like candy to a child"
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
"Happy, that's you"
You made my life brand new
"Lost as a little lam was I, till you came in"
My life began when Happy smiled
"Sweet, like candy to a child"
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now) 
Where have I been? 
What lifetime was I in? 
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was 
Till now
"Happy, yeah yeah"
"Happy, oehoe happy"
happy oh yeah Happy

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all
You better stop
Your doggin' around
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
'Cause if you don't stop
I'm gonna have to put you down
I can't take it much longer
My heart's getting weak
It's not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset
My head's in a whirl
"But if you wanna be, yeah"
Be my girl
You better stop
Your doggin' around
You know what I'm talkin' about
"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
If you don't stop
I'm gonna have to put you down
"Baby, yes I do, yes I do"
"Gonna, gonna put you down"
You're doggin' me [repeat 7x]
I'm gonna have to put you down Yeah
"Yes you do, you're doggin' me [repeat 3x]"
You better stop
Your doggin' me around
Free and untamed that's how I've grown
(It's Johnny Raven)
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
(It's Johnny Raven)
Oh your smile
"But tell me, ain't your child"
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild
Refrain
I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
by and by (By and By)
"Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl"
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
"Yeah, but I gotta leave you"
When my restless heart says goodbye
Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
(It's Johnny Raven)
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
(It's Johnny Raven)
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel
Refrain
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven
(It's Johnny Raven)

"Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl"
Another nest to try

"Love, Love, Love,Love"

"Euphoria, Euphoria, Euphoria,Euphoria"
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It's very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
"Do what you wish, be what you are"
What a victorious thrill
"Wearing a smile, all of the while"
Feeling the world standing still
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full euphoria
"Knowing no ills, needing no pills"
Singing a rock and roll hymn
"Feeling glorious, full of love"
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthly and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation
"Euphoria, euphoria"
Long as we love each other
"Euphoria, euphoria"
Living for one another
"Euphoria, euphoria"
That's one word for heaven
"Euphoria, euphoria"
living your live as Heaven
"Morning glow, morning glow"
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due
Morning glow fill the earth
Come on shine far all you're worth
We'll be present at the birth
Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due
Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago
Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here
Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago
Morning glow all of your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last
We've been together for such a long time now
"Music, music and me"
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
"Now music, music and me"
Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
"Like music, music and me"
Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony
Birds of a feather will fly together
"Now music, music and me"
Music and me
No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges
Can turn us around
Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found
[Refrain]
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
(Cause we're almost there) 
Just one more step
(Just one more step) 
Don't give up
'Cause we're almost all almost there
('Cause we're almost there) 
(Look at the lovers) 
Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
(Life's long hard climb) 
They just couldn't take it
(They just couldn't take it) 
Don't let it happen to me and you
"Hold on together, darlin'"
We'll make it through
"Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me"
"Keep on reachin, do it for me"
"Do it for me, cause baby"
[Refrain]
('Cause we're almost there) 
(We're almost there)

Need to feel your hand
Slippin' from mine? 
"Just hold on tighter now, darlin'"
Keep on tryin'

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to... 
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you
In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and... 
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
I'm on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the prolems that I caused you
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
"I just want you to take me, take me"
"Take me, take me, take me, take me"
"Take me back, forgive me"
Take me back where I belong
"If you can, if you can find it"
In your heart to forgive me
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
"You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . . "
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . . 
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
"Just call my name, and I'll be there"
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . . 
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
"Just call my name, and I'll be there"
[VERSE 1]

With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

And forever is meant for so very few
[BRIDGE]
We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you
[CHORUS]
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
[ad lib to fade]
Just a little bit of you every day

When I need just a smile
Suddenly the sun shines for a while 
Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along 
"Thanks to you I finally got a song, "

[Verse 1:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
"You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,"
You're paralyzed
[Chorus:]
"'Cause this is thriller, thriller night"
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
"You know it's thriller, thriller night"
"You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight"
[Verse 2:]
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind
You're out of time
[Chorus:]
"'Cause this is thriller, thriller night"
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
"You know it's thriller, thriller night"
"You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight"
[Bridge:]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life
[Verse 3:]
"They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side"
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
"All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,"
I'll make you see
[Chorus:]
"That it's a thriller, thriller night"
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
"Girl, this is thriller, thriller night"
"So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller"
Thriller here tonight
[Rap - Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
Can you dig it?!
"[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]"
"They told him, ""Don't you ever come around here."
"Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."""
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
"So beat it, just beat it"
"You better run, you better do what you can"
"Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man"
"You wanna be tough, better do what you can"
"So beat it, but you wanna be bad"
[Chorus]
"Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it"
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
"Just beat it, beat it [4x]"
"They're out to get you, better leave while you can"
"Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man"
"You wanna stay alive, better do what you can"
"So beat it, just beat it"
You have to show them that you're really not scared
"You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare"
"They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair"
"So beat it, but you wanna be bad"
[Chorus 2x]
"Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it"
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
"Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it"
"Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it"
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
[Chorus 3x]
"Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it"
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
"Just beat it, beat it"
"Beat it, beat it, beat it"
[1st verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
"I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one"
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
[2nd verse]
"She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene"
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
"She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
[3rd verse]
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
"So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice"
(do think twice.)
[4th verse]
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
"Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby"
[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
"She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
"She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
"She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
"She says I am the one, she says he is my son"
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

I can make you feel so right
Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinnin' by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you you're the lady in my life
Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
"As long as I know you'll be there, girl"
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
"Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh"
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
"Come to me, girl"
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life
"Stay with me, I want you to stay with me"
I need you by my side
Don't you go no where
(Ooh girl let me keep you warm)
Let me keep you warm
(You are the lady in my life)
You're my lady
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
I wanna squeeze ya
(Always the lady in my life)
I wanna touch you baby

"(Lay back in my tenderness) You're my lady, baby"
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.
Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top
Where else numbers two
"Let gets up and never stops, no"
"Ain't double same, loving me bring me game"
"Don't let it get you down, oh no"
Don't let it get you down
When the cards are wrong
Pick up and let them walked away
Before you loose your heart
"(Don't regret, girl) "
"Ain't double same, loving me bring me game"
Don't let it get you down
"(Oh, no) "
"Oh, no"
Don't get mean
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about
Don't get me
"Let me be the one to straighten it out, girl"
"(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it) "
"(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it) "
Ain't double same
Loving me bring me game
Don't let it get you down
"I can make you sunshine, make you happy"
"Ain't no clouds sky came out number me, yeah"
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
You can start again
Now yesterday is gone
Let tomorrow be your friend
"(Don't regret, girl) "
"Hey, don't regret girl, "
Mama is still ahead
"Don't let it get you down, "
"(Oh, no) "
Oh no
Don't get mean
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about
Don't get me
"Let me be, be the one to straighten it out, girl"
"I can't straighten it out, girl, yeah"
(Don't let it get you down) 
"I can't straighten it out, girl, come on"
(Don't let it get you down) 
"Don't let it, let it, let it... "
Don't let it get you down
I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
"Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly"
I love you madly
"You really got a hold on me,"
"You really got a hold on me, yeah"
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
"Hold me, hold me"
I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
"Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now"
My love is strong now
"You really got a hold on me, come on"
"You really got a hold on me, yeah"
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
"Hold me, hold me"
"I want to leave you, don't want to stay here"
Don't want to spend another day here
"Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now"
I can't quit now
"You really got a hold on me, come on"
"You really got a hold on me, baby"
You really got a hold on me
"You really got a hold on me, yeah"
"Yeah, yeah"
Got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
Yeah
I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost and passed away
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going know her way
There's sound of the melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind
"Melodie, you're my symphony"
All the song to me
You're my only
"Melodie, you're my everything"
Make me wanna sing
For you only
"Oh, oh"
(I see you love me) 
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
But when you lend my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me
All the girls have bringhten now
And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye you today
"Melodie, you're my symphony"
All the song to me
You're my only
"Melodie, you're my everything"
Make me wanna sing
For you only
Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know there's music to my ears
Every word that you say
"Melodie, you're my symphony"
All the song to me
You're my only
"Melodie, you're my everything"
Make me wanna sing
For you only
If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand
I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do
If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
"(You've got, you've gotta to touch"
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 
Would get embarrassed for every time
I've moved and make you cry
"You get sentimental, and"
I would never know the reason why
I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you
I only want to show you
That I'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...
Girl you're so together
"Together we can make it, all the way"
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
"I'd choose you babe, yeah"
It's no dreams
"But with proof as sweet as you, noo"
Apples peaches and cherries
"Just won't do, ooh baby"
Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it? 
Girl you're so together
"And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah"
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe
(Choose you babe) 
"Girl your smile, ooh"
"Is like the month of may, yeah"
When you're near me
"The storm clouds stay away, yeah"
Even the little honey bees
Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny
Girl you're so together
"And together we can make it all the way, yeah"
"Oh, girl, you're so together"
"Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper"
A real life traffic stopper
A knock-out queen
"Oh, what I mean is"
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
"Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe"
(Girl you're so together) 
Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way) 
"Ooh, girl, you're so together"
"Farewell my summer love, farewell"
"Girl I won't forget you, "
"Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh"
"I found my happiest days, "
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
"I told you that you sure looked good, now"
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
"(Bye, bye) "
Don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
"Farewell my summer love, farewell"
Girl I won't forget you
"Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah"
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
"Or someone that you don't forget, no? "
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
"You'll return, but until you do, baby"
"(Bye, bye) "
Don't turn around
You might see me cry
"Farewell my summer love, farewell"
Girl I won't forget you
"Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah"
"Farewell, farewell"
"Farewell, farewell"
"If you remember my name, "
(Drop a line) 
"Drop a line sometime, yeah"
"Yeah, ooh"
Girl I won't forget you
"Farewell my summer love, farewell"
Girl I won't forget you
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
"Or someone that you don't forget, no? "
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
"You'll return, but until you do, baby"
"(Bye, bye) "
Don't turn around
You might see me cry
"Farewell, my summer love, farewell, oohh, yeah"
"Farewell, my summer love, farewell"
There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me
Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you 
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
"Call on me, call on me "
"Yes, happiness"
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me
"Yes, happiness"
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me
I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
"I know it's you honey baby, yeah"
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand
"Oh, show me here I am baby, take me"
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...
To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
"I need not conquer worlds, or fame,"
"Not set, the pace for style"
If I can follow through
"on, what they gave me as my tools,"
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools
"If I don't come up, number one"
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done 
To always do my best
"By listening to me, myself"
So he can do or else
"(Of without compromise, "
Shall follow the feel of constant care) 
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
"while growing, still a child"
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile... 
(Proud)
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
"Come on, come on,"
Lay it on me
All right...
I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be...
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through...

You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
"Before too long,"
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
"Don't make a fight,"
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through...
"Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on"
"(Bad bad - really, really bad)"

I Thought She Had To Have It
Since The First Time She Came
Who Knows The Situation
Mysteries Do Remain
And Now I Wonder Why
I Breakdown When I Cry
Is It Something I Said
Or Is It Just A Lie
(Is It Just A Lie)
I Try So Hard To Love You
Some Things Take
Time And Shame
I Think The Whole World
Of You
Your Thoughts Of Me Remain
I'll Play The Fool For You
I'll Change The Rules For You
Just Say It And I'll Do
Just Make This Thing Come True
(Make A Dream Come True)
If I Let Her Get Away
Though I'm Begging
On My Knees
I'll Be Crying Everyday
Knowing The Girl
That Got Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Tried To Mastermind It
By Saying Let It Be
But Everytime I Did It
The Hurt Came Back At Me
I Told You That I Need You
A Thousand Times And Why
I Played The Fool For You
And Still You Said Goodbye
(Still You Said Goodbye)
If I Let Her Get Away
Then The World Will
Have To See
A Fool Who Lives Alone
And The Fool Who
Set You Free

I Can't Let Her Get Away

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
"Yes, we're one and the same"
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
"Girl, when the goin' gets mean"
[L. T. B. rap performance]
"Protection for gangs, clubs and nations"
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
"See, it's not about races"
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
[Michael]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
"Ooh, ooh"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, now"
"Ooh, ooh"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, now"
[2x]
"It's black, it's white"
It's tough for you to get by
"It's black, it's white, woo"
I Gave Her Money
I Gave Her Time
I Gave Her Everything
Inside One Heart Could Find
I Gave Her Passion
My Very Soul
I Gave Her Promises
And Secrets So Untold
And She Promised Me Forever
And A Day We'd Live As One
We Made Our Vows
We'd Live A Life Anew
And She Promised Me In Secret
That She'd Love Me For All Time
It's A Promise So Untrue
Tell Me What Will I Do?
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself
And The Reason Why She Left Me
Did She Find In Someone Else?
(Who Is It?)
It Is A Friend Of Mine
(Who Is It?)
Is It My Brother!
(Who Is It?)
"Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now"
(Who Is It?)
I Can't Take This Stuff No More
I Am The Damned
I Am The Dead
I Am The Agony Inside
The Dying Head
This Is Injustice
Woe Unto Thee
I Pray This Punishment
Would Have Mercy On Me
And She Promised Me Forever
That We'd Live Our Life As One
We Made Our Vows
We'd Live A Love So True
It Seems That She Has Left Me
For Such Reasons Unexplained
I Need To Find The Truth
But See What Will I Do!
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday
And She Didn't Leave A Letter
She Just Up And Ran Away
(Who Is It?)
It Is A Friend Of Mine
(Who Is It?)
Is It My Brother?
(Who Is It?)
"Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now"
(Who Is It?)
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely
(Who Is It?)
It Is Friend Of Mine
(Who Is It?)
To Me I'm Bothered
(Who Is It?)
"Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now"
(Who Is It?)
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seen Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself
And The Reason Why She Left Me
Did She Find Someone Else?
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday
And She Didn't Leave A Letter
She Just Up And Ran Away
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself

Did She Find Someone Else?
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought

'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself
And The Reason Why She Left Me
Did She Find Someone Else?
She Always Takes It With A Heart Of Stone
'Cause All She Does Is Throw It Back To Me
I've Spent A Lifetime 
Looking For Someone
Don't Try To Understand Me
Just Simply Do The 
Things I Say
Love Is A Feeling
Give It When I Want It
'Cause I'm On Fire
Quench My Desire
Give It When I Want It
Talk To Me Woman
Give In To Me
Give In To Me
You Always Knew Just How To Make Me Cry
And Never Did I Ask You Questions Why
It Seems You Get Your Kicks From Hurting Me
Don't Try To Understand Me
Because Your Words Just Aren't Enough
Love Is A Feeling
Quench My Desire
Give It When I Want It
Takin' Me Higher
Love Is A Woman
I Don't Wanna Hear It
Give In To Me

And I Will Then Say To Thee
You Are My Friend
Carry Me
Like You Are My Brother
Love Me Like A Mother
Will You Be There?
Weary
Tell Me Will You Hold Me
"When Wrong, Will You Scold Me"
When Lost Will You Find Me?
But They Told Me
A Man Should Be Faithful
And Walk When Not Able
And Fight Till The End
But I'm Only Human
Everyone's Taking Control Of Me
Seems That The World's
Got A Role For Me
I'm So Confused
Will You Show To Me
You'll Be There For Me
And Care Enough To Bear Me
(Hold Me)
(Lay Your Head Lowly)
(Softly Then Boldly)
(Carry Me There)
(Lead Me)
(Love Me And Feed Me)
(Kiss Me And Free Me)
(I Will Feel Blessed)
(Carry)

In My Trials

Like A Comet
Blazing 'Cross The Evening Sky 
Gone Too Soon
Like A Rainbow
Fading In The Twinkling Of An Eye
Gone Too Soon
Shiny And Sparkly
And Splendidly Bright
Here One Day
Gone One Night
Like The Loss Of Sunlight
On A Cloudy Afternoon
Gone Too Soon
Like A Castle
Built Upon A Sandy Beach
Gone Too Soon
Like A Perfect Flower
That Is Just Beyond Your Reach
Gone Too Soon
"Born To Amuse, To Inspire, To Delight"
Here One Day
Gone One Night
Like A Sunset
Dying With The Rising Of The Moon
Gone Too Soon
Gone Too Soon
The Way She Came Into The Place
I Knew Right Then And There
There Was Something Different
About This Girl
The Way She Moved
"Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines"
Divinity In Motion
As She Stalked The Room 
I Could Feel The Aura
Of Her Presence
Every Head Turned 
Feeling Passion And Lust
The Girl Was Persuasive
The Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew But I Was
Walking The Line
Come Go With Me
I Said I Have No Time
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
Talk On The Phone
My Baby Cried
She Left Me Standing Alone
She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me
She Came At Me In Sections
With The Eyes Of Desire
I Fell Trapped Into Her
Web Of Sin
"A Touch, A Kiss"
A Whisper Of Love
I Was At The Point 
Of No Return
Deep In The Darkness Of
Passion's Insanity
I Felt Taken By Lust's
Strange Inhumanity
This Girl Was Persuasive
This Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew
But I Was Living In Vain
She Called My House
She Said You Know My Name
And Don't You Pretend 
You Never Did Me Before
With Tears In Her Eyes
My Baby Walked Out The Door
She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey 
But You're No Damn Good For Me 
Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
I Have To Pray To God
'Cause I Know How
Lust Can Blind
It's A Passion In My Soul
But You're No Damn Lover
Friend Of Mine
I Can not Sleep Alone Tonight
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
You And Your Manipulation
You Hurt My Baby
And Then It Happened
She Touched Me
For The Lips Of
A Strange Woman
Drop As A Honeycomb
And Her Mouth Was
Smoother Than Oil

I was wandering in the rain
"Mask of life, feelin' insane"
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
"And again, and again, and again..."
Take my name and just let me be
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Like stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)
Like stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)

We're talkin' danger
"We're talkin' danger, baby"
Like stranger in Moscow
[2x]
I'm living lonely
"I'm living lonely, baby"

Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
"Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see"
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer nigga I ain't jokin'
Endo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'
The fool comes slippin'
So I could blow'em open
This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rocks
Got Pitts by the door
I've raised other peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time

That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

[Verse 1:]
Money.
Money...
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money
So you go to church
Read the Holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
"You're called the ""Just Few"""
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You'll do anything for money...
[Chorus:]
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
[Verse 2:]
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cause your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
"Of lust, gluttoney and greed?"
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You'll do anything for money...
[Chorus:]
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
[Verse 3:]
You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God
Then you will hell him
You'll do anything for money
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything now
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Here come ol' flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He's got Joo Joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
He wear no shoe shine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
"He say ""I know you, you know me"""
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together
Right now
Over me
He bag production
He's got walrus gum-boot
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his arm 'til
You can feel his disease
Come together
Right now
Over me
Come together babe
Come together babe
Come together
Come together
He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one Mojo filter
"He say ""One and one and one is three"""
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together
Right now
Over me
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
"'Lone, 'lone"
"Why, 'lone"
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
you are not alone
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone...
Not alone ohh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
"Not alone, Not alone"
If you just reach out for me girl
"In the morning, in the evening"
"Not alone, not alone"
You and me not alone
Oh together together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
"Like a child, but pardon me..."
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
"It's been my fate to compensate,"
for the Childhood
I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
"Like pirates in adventurous dreams,"
Of conquest and kings on the throne...
"Before you judge me, try hard to love me,"
"Look within your heart then ask,"
Have you seen my Childhood?
People say I'm strange that way
"'Cause I love such elementary things,"
"It's been my fate to compensate,"
for the Childhood I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
"The dreams I would dare, watch me fly..."
"Before you judge me, try hard to love me."
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my Childhood...
Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory
It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
"And you don't have to read it, read it"
"And you don't have to eat it, eat it"
"To buy it is to feed it, feed it"
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
"Don't make it factual, actual"
They say he's homosexual
In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory
It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
"And you don't go and buy it, buy it"
"And they won't glorify it, 'fy it"
"To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it"
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
"See, but everybody wants to believe all about it"
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
"See, but everybody wants to believe all about it"
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
"Don't make it factual, actual"
She's blonde and she's bisexual
Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
"And you don't go and buy it, buy it"
"And they won't glorify it, 'fy it"
"To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it"
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
"See, but everybody wants to read all about it"
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
"Don't make it factual, actual"
You're so damn disrespectable
Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
"You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah"
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
"But too bad, too bad"
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
"Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah"
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
"But too bad, too bad"
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad too bad about it

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...
A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
"Lift her with care,"
Oh the blood in her hair...
Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
"Her face bear such agony, such strain..."
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...
It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...
She knew no one cared...
"Father left home, poor mother died"
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...
Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair
"Smile, though your heart is aching"
"Smile, even though it's breaking"
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile 
If you just...
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
"Smile, what's the use of crying"
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...
"Smile, though your heart is aching"
"Smile, even though it's breaking"
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile...
That's the time you must keep on trying
"Smile, what's the use of crying"
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right
She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill
She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past
Every night stance is like takin a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right
Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
She put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife 
Susie's got your number 
Susie says its right
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aaow
There's a tappin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it
Hey!
Don't understand it
Hey.
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
"And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me"
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
There's a tappin in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it!
Yeah Yeah!
Don't understand it!
Your just a dog gone!
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
"And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me"
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
"And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?"
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
"And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me"
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
"You put a knife in my back,"
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
"And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me"
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
"And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?"
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
"And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me"
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
Aaow
Dog gone
"But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind"
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
There's a ghost out in the hall 
Theirs a goul beneath the bed 
Now it's coming through the walls 
Now it's coming down the stairs 
Then there's screaming in the dark 
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air 
Ghosts be hiding everywhere 
I'm gonna be 
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose haunting me 
Your warning me 
To be the stranger 
In your life 
Am I amusing you 
Or just confusing you 
Am I the beast 
You visualised 
And if you wanna to see 
Eccentrialities 
I'll be grotesque 
Before your eyes 
Let them all materialise
Is that scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you oh
Is it scary for you baby 
Is it scary for you 
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby 
There's a creak beneath the floor 
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there 
Their's a ghostly smell around 
But nobody to be found 
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke 
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see 
So did you come to me 
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes 
A haunting ghostly treat 
The foolish trickery 
And spirits dancing 
In the light 
But if you came to see 
The truth the purity 
It's here inside 
A lonely heart 
So let the performance start 
Is that scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you oh 
Am I scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you 
So tell me is it scary for you baby
So tell me is it crazy for you baby 
Am I scary for you 
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya
Masquerade the heart 
Is the height of haunting souls 
Just not what you seek of me 
Can the heart reveal the proof 
Like a mirror reveals the truth 
See the evil one is you
Is that scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you oh
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you 
So tell me am I scary for you baby 
Am I scary for ya baby 
Is is scary for ya baby 
Am I scary for you 
(I don't wanna talk about it)
Am I scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you 
I'm tired of being abused 
You know you're scaring me too 
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby
Now I'm just wondering why you think 
that you can get to me with anything 
seems like you'd know by now 
When and how I get down 
"And with all that I've been through, "
I'm still around 
Don't you ever make no mistake 
Baby I've got what it takes 
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
"'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby "
[CHORUS]
"You can't believe it, you can't conceive it "
"and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable "
"and I know you hate it, and you can't take it "
"You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable "
Now you can't stop me even thought you think 
"that if you block me, you've done your thing "
and when you bury me underneath all your pain 
"I´m steady laughin', while surfacing "
Don't you ever make no mistake 
baby I've got what it takes 
and there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
"'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby "
[CHORUS 2x]
"You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing "
"no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here "
Through all your lies and silly games 
"I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable "
[RAP]
[CHORUS 3x]
"Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs "
she only knows how low that she can go 
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
"She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant "
"only for me, then spoke with her body "
her only goal is just to take control 
And I can't believe that I can´t tell her no 
[CHORUS]
That girl I can't take her 
should have known she was a heartbreaker 
that girl I can't take her 
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
that girl I can't take her 
should have seen right thriough her 
she's a heartbreaker 
She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 
[CHORUS 2x]
I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
Stop being without you 
"But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you "
and start being without you 
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
and stop talkin' aboout you 
and what will she say? 
She will say I was the man that got away 
[RAP ]
[CHORUS OUT]
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
"If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me"
"And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me"
"And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me"
"And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me"
[Chorus:]
"So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible"
"But I can do anything, she's invincible"
"Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible"
"Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible"
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
"If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me"
"And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me"
"And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me"
"And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me"
[Chorus]
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
"Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy"
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby
[RAP]
[Chorus x3]
"Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine"
"You and me, makin love all the way through another night"
I remember you and I walking though the park at night
"Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go"
"Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love"
"People talk, people say what we have is just a game"
"Oh, Ill never let you go, come here girl"
Just got to make sweet love til the break of dawn
[Chorus]
I dont want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I dont know what Im gonna do I cant stop lovin you
I wont stop til break of dawn makin love
"Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes youve got me nervous yet"
"Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise"
Theres imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places youve never know
"Break of dawn, theres no sun up in the sky"
"Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes"
"Break of dawn, girl you got to understand"
"Its the way that I love you, let me show you Im your man"
Break of dawn
[Chorus x 2]
"Lets not wait, the sun is out, lets get up and lets get out"
"Its the day, a brand new day, lets both go outside and play"
"Let us walk down the park, makin love til its dark"
"Let me move, let me soothe, til the break of dawn and you know its true, oh"
[Chorus x 3]
[CHORUS]
"Tell the angels no, I dont wanna leave my baby alone"
I dont want nobody else to hold you
Thats a chance Ill take
"Baby Ill stay, Heaven can wait"
"No, if the angels took me from this earth"
I would tell them bring me back to her
"Its a chance Ill take, maybe Ill stay"
Heaven can wait
Youre beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl its incredible
"And I dont know what Id do, if I cant be with you"
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
"I wouldnt wanna go if I cant see your face, cant hold you close"
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me Id tell them no
[CHORUS]
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when youd be moving on
Id turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
"Cant stand to see nobody kissing, touching her"
Couldnt take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me Id tell them no
[CHORUS]
"Oh no, cant be without my baby"
"Wont go, without her Id go crazy"
"Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting"
Ooh
"Oh no, cant be without my baby"
"Wont go, without her Id go crazy"
"Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting"
Ooh
[CHORUS]
"Just leave us alone, leave us alone"
Please leave us alone
Ho...oh...
My life will never be the same
"'Cause girl, you came and changed"
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain the things I feel for you
"But girl, you know it's true"
"Stay with me, fulfill my dreams"
And I'll be all you'll need
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)"
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my
life)
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)"
"Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See, I"
"finally found, come on, girl)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did"
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
"You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)"
"And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)"
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
"Girl, you know it seems"
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)"
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all
my life (Searched for all my life)
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find"
(Whoa...oh...oh...)
"Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come"
"on, come on, come on)"
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
"You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know"
you did
"And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)"
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)
"You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)"
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
"You rocked my world (Oh...), you know you did"
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
"Girl, I know that this is love"
I felt the magic all in the air
"And girl, I'll never get enough"
"That's why I always have to have you here, hoo"
"You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know"
you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to
"me, baby, yeah)"
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
"You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,"
baby)
And everything I own I give ('Cause you rocked my
world)
"The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)"
Someone like you to call mine
(You rocked my world)
"You rocked my world, you know you did"
"(The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me)"
(The way you give it to me)
"You rocked my world, you know you did"
(Give it to me)
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah...ooh)"
"You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know"
you did
"(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)"
"(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl),"
you know you did
"(Baby, baby, baby)"
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
"You rocked my world, you know you did"
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
"Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah"
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when 
I'm trying to get through
"To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh"
I just wanna touch you
[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
"You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
"All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real"
"You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me"
"I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen"
"I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true"
Oh baby you give me butterflies
[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
"You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
"You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
"If you would take my hand, baby I would show you"
Guide you to the light babe
"If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you"
'Til the end of time
[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
"You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
"You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
"You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
"Your love is magical, that's how I feel "
But I have not the words here to explain 
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion 
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain 
To tell you how I feel 
"But I am speechless, speechless "
That's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
"When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say "
"My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray "
"Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside "
"Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side "
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found 
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground 
"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel "
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face 
There's no mountain high I cannot climb 
I'm humbled in your grace 
"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel "
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel "
"Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real "
"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel "
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
"SpeechlessYour love is magical, that's how I feel "
But in your presence I am lost for words 
"Words like, ""I love you."""
"Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go"
Just enough to make your juices flow
"Press play, dont stop, rotate, too hot"
You feel Im real
"Im everything you need, so tell me whats the deal"
[CHORUS]
"2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong"
"Too much of that, fuse blown"
Be careful what you say dont overload
"2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong"
"Too much of that, fuse blown"
Be careful what you say dont overload
"3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby"
"Release two or three, when  I reach I can go til I hit my peak"
"Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady"
Shorty really wanna be there for me
[CHORUS]
[AD LIBS]
[CHORUS OUT]
Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
"On my own, I was lonely"
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light
[Chorus:]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life
Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
"No more tears, no more pain"
'cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life
[Chorus]
You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me
Dont walk away
See I just cant find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so youll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray
[CHORUS 1]
And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When theres nothing left to do but walk away
I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But its been so long now all I do is cry
Cant we find some love to take this away
Cause the pain gets stronger every day
[CHORUS 2]
How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When theres nothing left to do but walk away
See now why
All my dreams been broken
I dont know where were going
Everything we said and all we done now
"Dont let go, I dont wanna walk away"
Now why
All my dreams been broken
Dont know where were going
Everything begins to set us free
"Cant you see, I dont wanna walk away"
"If you go, I wont forget you girl"
Cant you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There nothing left to do
Dont walk away
"Aint the pictures enough, why do you go through so much"
"To get the story you need, so you can bury me"
"Youve got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose"
You try to get me to lose the man I really am
"You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy"
wont you just let me be
"cause you cameras cant control, the minds of those who know"
That youll even sell your soul just to get a story sold
[CHORUS]
"I need my privacy, I need my privacy"
"So paparazzi, get away from me"
"Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die"
"To get a message across, that yet you havent heard"
"My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew"
"But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away"
"Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed"
Please tell my why
"No theres a lesson to learn, respects not given, its earned"
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
[CHORUS]
"Now theres a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned"
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
[CHORUS x 3]
[Verse 1]
Somebody shakes when the wind blows
"Somebody's missing a friend, hold on"
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end
[Verse 2]
Stories buried and untold
"Someone is hiding the truth, hold on"
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?
[Chorus:]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
[Verse 3]
People laugh when they're feelin sad
"Someone is taking a life, hold on"
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
when your children cried last night?
[Verse 4]
Faces fill with madness
"Miracles unheard of, hold on"
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is reach for the truth
[Chorus]
And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers
[Chorus x3]
Change the world
"We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers"
Wishing our families well
"We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing"
But not for the missing
[CHORUS 1]
So this ones for all the lost children
This ones for all the lost children
"This ones for all the lost children, wishing them well"
And wishing them home
"When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings"
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because Im keeping a place
[CHORUS 2]
For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
"This ones for all the lost children, wishing them well"
And wishing them home
"Home with their fathers,"
"Snug close and warm, loving their mothers"
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee
[CHORUS 3]
So pray for all the lost children
Lets pray for all the lost children
"Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well"
This is for all the lost children
This ones for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
"Wishing them well, and wishing them home"
"He gives another smile, tries to understand her side"
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says
[Chorus]
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"Everything will be alright, he assures her"
But she doesn't hear a word that he say
"Preoccupied, she's afraid"
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
"He doesn't know what to say, so he prays"
"Whatever, whatever, whatever"
[Chorus]
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand"
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
"He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy"
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
"She tried to explain, ""It's you that makes me happy,"""
"Whatever, whatever, whatever"
[Chorus]
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand"
"See, don't you do it baby"
I said yeah
Don't you let go baby
"See, you"
Don't you do it
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"
"Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand"
Don't you let go baby
"Don't you, don't you let go"
I said yeah
Can I get how it feels baby
Don't you let go baby
Yeah
Oh
"Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand."
"[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!"
"[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!"
[ROD SERLING INTRO]
Tonights story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
"He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion"
"Oh yes, I did forget something didnt I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster."
"Youre fearing me, cause you know Im a beast"
"Watching you when you sleep, when youre in bed"
Im underneath
"Youre trapped in halls, and my face is the walls"
"Im the floor when you fall, and when you scream its cause of me"
"Im the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head"
I heard just what you said
Thats why youve got to be threatened by me
[CHORUS]
"You should be watching me, you should feel threatened"
"While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened"
"Every time your lady speaks she speaks of me, threatened"
"Half of me youll never be, so you should feel threatened by me"
"You think youre by yourself, but its my touch you felt"
"Im not a ghost from Hell, but Ive got a spell on you"
"Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere"
"In one blink Ill disappear, and then Ill come back to haunt you"
"Im telling you, when you lie under a tomb"
Im the one watching you
Thats why you got to be threatened by me
[CHORUS]
[ROD SERLING VERSE]
The unknown monster is about to embark
"From a far corner, out of the dark"
"A nightmare, thats the case"
"Never Neverland, thats the place"
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
"This is judgement night, execution, slaughter"
"The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture"
"You can be sure of one thing, thats fate"
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
"A monster, the worst thing to fear."
[CHORUS x 3]
[ROD SERLING OUTRO]

Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
[Chorus:]
"I wanna spend, time to live in"
I wanna fall with you again
"Like we did, when we first met"
I wanna fall with you again
"Fought in a battle, where nobody won"
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
"You can't run away, past the said and done"
I need us to carry on
[Chorus]
"You tried everything, you never thought of before"
"When you live, in your love"
"And you give, in your love"
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
"I can live, I can breathe"
I can die in my sleep
Cause you're always there in my dreams
[Chorus 2x]
"(All of the time, here in my heart)"
You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier 
And you still deal with the fires 
That they made...

Well lord have mercy

This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me babe
Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me babe
Tell me what's goin' down babe
Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
I don't even wanna say it
Cause of all the blasphemy
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey Business goin' down
Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
"Don't be callin' out ""Mercy me"""
Don't be callin' down babe
Said lord have mercy
Even burst the breast
"Don't be callin' out ""Mercy me"""
Don't be goin' down babe
Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business goin' down
I read the paper
And I can't believe what's goin' round
Somebody's doin' it to
"Somebody's up, somebody's down"
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shy with me
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
You're dirty
You're dirty
"Dirty, dirty baby"
Your brother's gone and kissed
The mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Your brother didn't make a nickel
Or dime too
Sittin' round tellin' how he did it to you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business goin' down
Goin' down babe
Monkey business goin' down
I'm not satisfied baby
Monkey business goin' down
You wanna party
Monkey business goin' down
"My business, is your business"
Monkey business goin' down
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Monkey business goin' down
"Monkey see, monkey do"
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
"Your business, is my business"
Monkey business goin' down
"Your business, is my business"
Monkey business goin' down
Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the 
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon
She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon
The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
"My friend, my someone in the dark was you"
Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Though you're gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I'll remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears
When someone in the dark reaches out for you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me!
All alone she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doing wrong
On the move got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the news
You're living on sunset time
(Uuh)
Feeling bad
You're living much too fast
"The truth, the truth that you're on the pass"
In the raw they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breaking every law
[CHORUS]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)
On the go
Got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
"Living hot, doing what you should not"
The break is on me then what do you got
We're living on sunset time
(Want that dime)
Shoot the breeze
You feel that she's the tease
Your night is free what you wanna be
Who's to trust when living dangerous
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose
[CHORUS]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Getting higher
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)
(uuh)
(pah dah dah dah)
You are there when the night's in town
Standing there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema
You think there's nothing wrong
Going town
You do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon
Gotta fever in your shoes
The night's on you
What are you gonna do?
[CHORUS]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

(aah) (pah dah dah)

I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Ooooooh

It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
"The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,"
"You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,"
"I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,"
Ooooooh
"I like the way how you're holdin' me,"
"It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,"
"I like the way how you're lovin' me,"

"It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,"
You see
Ooooooh [x10]
We're on a mission
In the everlasting light that shines
A revelation
Of the truth in chapters of our minds
"So long, bad times"
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharing light brighter than the sun
"Hello , good times"
"We're here to simulate, eliminate"
"An' congregate, illuminate"
(We are here to change the world)
"Gonna change the world, Hee"
(We are here to change the world)
"Gonna change the world, Ooo"
So do surrender
'Cause the power's deep inside my soul
Sing it

"Gonna change the world, Sing it"
(We are here to change the world)
"Hee, Gonna change the world, Ooo"
(We are here to change the world)
"We're gonna change the world, girl"

"Hee, Deep down in my body,"
"Deep down in my soul, Baby"
(We are here to change the world)
"Hee, We're gonna change the world,"
Ooo
Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dimelight
From one more violent crime
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
"He's awaken, ground is shakin"
His father grabs his hand
"Screaming, crying, his wife's dying"
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
"If they're for peace, why is there war?"
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids
We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and let God decide
Deep in my soul
It's up to me and I'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
"Just let God decide,"
It's going on baby
Just let God decide
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
"We can't, we can't"
We've already had enough
"Uh, oh,..."
Uh...

Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tanned
in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
"She's headed for the big time, that means"
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
"It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again"
West bound Greyhound
To tinsel town
Just to pursue her movie star dreams
She's giving hot tricks to men
just to get in
When she was taught that that's not clean
"She's headed for the big time, that means"
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
"It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)"
[Spoken words:]
"She gave up her life, to follow her dreams"
"Left behind everything, for the movie scene"
"Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan"
"She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad"
"Now that she got her dream, she became a star"
"It all looked so good, but only good from afar"
"Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could"
"Now it's back to reality, for Ms. Hollywood"
Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tanned

She's going Hollywood tonight
"It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)"
"She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,"
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
"She's working two jobs, keeping alive,"
"She works in a restaurant night and day,"
"She waits her life away,"
She wipes her tears away.
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries
No...
[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
"Keeping your mind to stay alive,"
Give me your wings so we can fly!
"Keep your head up, tonight!"
"Keeping your head up to the sky,"
"Or we can just rise up, tell me now"
Give me your wings so we can fly!
"Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,"
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
"I can't even breathe (just lean on me),"
I can't even see!
"Keep your head up, don't give up, today!"
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today!
"All you need is love,"
I tell you I know it's coming soon
"And all you need is just a moment, won't it do"
Keep your head up!
[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
"Keeping your mind to stay alive,"
"Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)"
"Keep your head up, tonight!"
"Keeping your head up to the sky,"
"Or we can just rise up, tell me now"
"Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my..."
"Everybody say that time is borrowed,"
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
"Just give yourself a chance,"
"Fight the circumstance,"
Rise and do it again
[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
"Keeping your mind to stay alive,"
Give me your wings so we can fly
"Keeping your head up to the sky,"
"Or we can just rise up, tell me now"
Give me your wings so we can fly!
[in background:]
I need your love
I need you now
I need your light right here today
I need you now
Keeping your head up to the sky!
"Keeping your mind to stay alive,"
Give me your wings so we can fly
"Keeping your head up to the sky,"
"Or we can just rise up, tell me now"
Give me your wings so we can fly!

"I am your joy, your best of joy"
"I am the moon light, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing"
"You know I always will love you, I am forever"
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around (the only one around)
When things will hurt you
I am forever.
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
"Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you"
"I am forever, I am forever"
"We are forever, we are forever"
I am a friend through thick and thin
"We need each other,"
"We'll never part,"
Our love is from the heart
"We never say, ""I don't need you"""
We are forever
I am the one who said that you are free
When it seems so hard to be the only one
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the words keep turning down
When things would hurt you
"I am forever, I am forever"
"We are forever, we are forever"
"You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded"
"Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around"
When things would hurt you
"We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever"
"We are forever,  keep on, we are forever,  keep on, have to be strong"
"We are forever, we are forever, oh right"
"I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever"
"I am forever, I am forever."
Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson
Just when you thought he was done
He comes to give it again
They could print it around the world today
He wanna write my obituary
"No matter what, you just want to read it again"
"No matter what, you just want to feel it again"
[Chorus:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman youre thinking of?
How am I crazy cause I just dont know
This is breaking news
This is breaking news
Everybody watching the news on Michael Jackson
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson
You write the words to destroy like its a weapon
You turned your back on a love and you cant get it again.
"No matter what, you just want to read it again"
"No matter what, you just want to feel it again"
[Chorus x2:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman youre thinking of?

How am I crazy cause I just dont know
This is breaking news

You're breaking the news!
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)
At night pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
"I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through"
"I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love"
[x2]
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)
All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
it cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
and you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
Cos when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
You know me
(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)
"(All is grand, all is bright)"
"All is grand, all is bright"
(You're just studying my mind)
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
Your sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
"So take off the mask, so I can see your face"
Who do you love?

She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
"And she answered ""No"" to me but"
I guess I learned my lesson much to soon
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
"And she answered ""No"" to me but"
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole
I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
Day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
"Oh, oh"
"Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon"
Are you ready for a real good time
Are you ready for a real good treat
"There'll be so much dancing, singing"
I let you fall into me
[Chorus:]

Dont be messin around hey hey hey
"Dont be messin around, dont be messin around"
Dont be messin around hey
If I started now in the deep
Think you said this feeling is your life
Ill be so proud if you let me love ya girl
Let me love ya for a little while
[Chorus:]
"Dont be messin around, dont be messin around"
Dont be messin around hey hey hey
"So dont be messin around, dont be messin around"
Dont be messin around hey
"Oho yeah yeah,"
"Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah"
Now she started finger popping to the beat
So I said lets get right on the floor
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No no don't mess around with me
I ain't playing
[Chorus:]
"Dont be messin around, dont be messin around"
Dont be messin around hey hey hey
"So dont be messin around, dont be messin around"
Dont be messin around hey hey
[Chorus x2]
There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you

"There you are, I walk alone"
Telling me to love you

What about all I saw?
What would you do?
Dont get so confused
Love all the things
Its just the things I do

You're the one that I adore you
Everyone they don't know me
"Tell me things they all believe, I do"
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
"Uh, uh, uh, baby"
Yesterday is when I felt down
And you save my faith off the ground
And you have to say you looked at me
"All they say, I do"
"That's right, I want to be"
"Free, free like the wind blow"
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I'm in my
You're the one that I adore
"Just kiss me once, I wanna know you"
Feel the vibe cause I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
"Uh, uh, uh, no"
Yesterday when I felt down I start
Try to make [?] I was around and y'know
Life is just a thing you dont
Pass the way I do
Because I want to be
"Free, free like the wind blow"
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
"Free, free like the wind blow"
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
"I'm in my (day, alright)"
"Oh, ah"
Alright
Ah ah
Oh yeah
Yesterday is when I felt down
I start try to make it look like I was around
"And ya try to make a way to see, what it is i do,"
Because I want to be
"Free, free like the wind blow"
To fly away just like a sparrow
To feel letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
"Free, free like the wind blow"
(Free like the wind babe)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
To feel letting my hair blow
"(I'll take my time, baby)"
To take my time wherever I go
(Take my time wherever I go)
I want to be
"Free, free like the wind blow"
(Free like the wind)
"To fly away just like a sparrow (Oh, my, my)"
To feel letting my hair blow
"(Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby)"
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
"Free, free like the wind blow"
"(You'll be free, now)"
(I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I wanna be free)
To feel letting my hair blow
"(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)"
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
(Hoo!)
"I've got to be free, baby!"
[Laughing]
"Ronny, you're so silly."
I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way that things could have been
She said that I don't care
"I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise"
Someone called out my name
"They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab"
My joy had turned to pain
"Father always told me,"
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
"I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win"
"I'm done in my pain, don't you feel no pain? (No way!)"
"It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame"
So don't be feelin' no pain!
"It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame"
So don't you ever complain!
"I am the cover of the magazine, what a scene"
They know my every do's
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine."
That always bothers me
"Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind"
Someone is following you
"You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad"
They know your every move!
My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
"I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win"
"I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!"
"It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame"
So don't you ever complain!
"It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame"
So don't be feelin' no pain!
"It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! (uh)"
Father never lies
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling this way boy!
"I'd like to take sometime and get away, then they'll say,"
Is that boy still alive? (uh)
The week in village...what a thrill
Only the strong survive
"My father always told me,"
"You won't live a quiet life,"
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy (oh?)
Then stand here in my shoes
And then think of my blues!
Its the price of fame!
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feeling this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (price of fame)
"My father never lies, baby"
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling no pain boy!
Why did you let him get away?
"After the staring, what did you say?"
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?
"Too bad, forget it"
'Cause Al Capone said it
"So sad, regret it"
'Cause a madman's out tonight
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Como la brisa
Tu voz me acaricia
Y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece
Tu amor aparece
Y me hace feliz
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que nadie te querra
Como yo
Tu me haces sentir
"Deseos de vivir,"
Junto a ti por siempre
Tu amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama
Tu eres quien gana
En mi corazon
Porque me has dado
Algo sagrado
Con tu pasion
Me conoces bien
Y sabas tambien
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estas
No hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida
Si tu te vas
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor
"Soy joven, lo se"
Pero siento que
Te quiero y sola
Viva por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tu
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de
Lo que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Cambiaremos al mundo manana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
Es mi vida y
Quiero estar junto a ti
Todo mi amor eres tu
"(now baby, oh)"
Todo mi amor eres tu
(if I ain't stop!)
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo que das tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu ...
Je ferme les yeux
Je me sens fiévreux
Sans toi j'ai froid
J'aimerais t'appeler
"J'aimerais prononcer que toi, que toi"
Ce que je ressens
Personne ne comprend
Je me sens si bien de t'aimer
Pour la première fois
Je sais que c'est toi
J'ai besoin de rêver
Je vais t'emmener
L'été finira
Près du feu de bois
On fera l'amour
Blottie contre toi
Je te dirai tout bas
Tu me rends folle
Ce que je ressens personne ne comprend
Je me sens si bien près de toi
J'en perd ma fierté
Je ne veux plus tricher
La vérité pour moi
C'est la vie avec toi
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et danser tout l'hiver
Sans toi c'est un enfer
Ne t'en vas pas
Et pouvoir t'embrasser
J'en tremble rien d'y penser
Tout te donner
Les femmes d'avant toi
Ne comptent même pas
J'ai oublié tout ton passé
Le terre pous trembler
La guerre éclater
Je supporterai tout
Écoute-moi mon amour
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Notre amour brillera dans ce monde
Il m'a vraiment tout apporté
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme
"Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garder"
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous

Ghost in the mirror
"I knew your face once, but now it's unclear"
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
"We lost connection, oh come back to me"
So I can feel alive again
"Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time"
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
"To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror"
"I knew your face once, but now it's unclear"
And I can't feel my body now
"I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart, this time"
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange

And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
"No matter what I do, I'm no good without you"
And I can't get enough
"Must be love on the brain Baby, keep loving me"
"Just love me, yeah"
Just love me

Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
"Just start loving me (loving me) Oh, and babe I'm fist fighting with fire"
Just to get close to you
"Can we burn something, babe?"
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
"Must be love on the brain, yeah"
And it keeps cursing my name (cursing my name)
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
"Must be love on the brain I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right"
"I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind"
"I need to get out of sight, fore I end up behind bars What started out as a simple altercation"
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing

"I pulled out that gun Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum"

But its too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking

Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well 'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
"A murderer Our love, his trust"
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Uh
Anymore And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer
A murderer

Before the sprinklers come on
"Talkin' 'bout ""Girl, I love you you're the one"""
This just looks like a re-run
(Please)

Oh How 'bout a round of applause?
Standin' ovation But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
Go on and take a bow But it's over now All along it was a fever
"A cold sweat, hot headed believer"
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
"He said, if you dare come a little closer Round and around and around and around we go"
"Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know Not really sure how to feel about it"
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay It's not much of a life you're living
"It's not just something you take, it's given"
"Round and around, and around, and around we go"
"Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know Not really sure how to feel about it"
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay Oh the reason I hold on
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
"'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving Not really sure how to feel about it"
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
"I want you to stay, stay"
"I want you to stay, oh Na na na, come on"
"Na na na, come on"
"Na na na, na na come on"
"Na na na, come on, come on"
"Come on, na na-na na come on"
"Na na na, come on"
"Na na na, na na, come on"
"Na na na, come on, come on"
"Come on, na na na na Feels so good being bad"
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure
"'Cause nothing can measure Love is great, love is fine"
"Out the box, out of line"
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
"Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it"
"Sticks and stones may break my bones,"
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
"Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it"
"Sticks and stones may break my bones,"
"But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on, come on, come on,"
"I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it Love is great, love is fine"
"Out the box, out of line"
"The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more, 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it"
"Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it"
"Sticks and stones may break my bones,"
"But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on, come on, come on,"
"I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it S, S, S and M, M, M"
"S, S, S and M, M, M Oh I love the feeling you bring to me"
"Oh, you turn me on"
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
"Make my body say ah, ah, ah,"
"I like it, like it 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it"
"Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it"
"Sticks and stones may break my bones,"
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
"Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it"
"Sticks and stones may break my bones,"
"But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on, come on, come on,"
"I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on"
"I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on"

"S, S, S and M, M, M"
"S, S, S and M, M, M"
"S, S, S and M, M, M On the first page of our story"
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
"Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices"
Glass is shattered from the fight
"In this tug of war, you'll always win"
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
"Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist"
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
"In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face"
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
"Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry"
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
"Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me"
"Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me"
"Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the"
"Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we"
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
"That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky"
"Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,"
"You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?"
"I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count"
"But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain"
"Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling"
"This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand"
"Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it"
"With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn"
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
"You and I, you and I"
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
"When you hold me, I'm alive"
We're like diamonds in the sky I knew that we'd become one right away
"Oh, right away"
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
"I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright, tonight you and I"
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
"Eye to eye, so alive"
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
"Feel the warmth, we'll never die"
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
"When you hold me, I'm alive"
We're like diamonds in the sky At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
"I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright, tonight you and I"
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
"Eye to eye, so alive"
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond [Narration]
"It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear"
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
"That without them, you feel like nothing"
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
"And when it's over, and it's gone"
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good [Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
"As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine) We found love in a hopeless place"
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place On the first page of our story

"If you play, you play the key"
"Take the gun, and count to three"
"I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow"
"No time to think, my turn to go And you can see my heart, beating,"
You can see it through my chest
"I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no"
I know that I must pass this test
"So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) Say a prayer, to yourself"
"He says, close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
"And then I get, a scary thought"
"That he's here, means he's never lost And you can see my heart, beating,"
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger As my life flashes before my eyes
"I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?"
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
"But it's too late to think of the value of my life And you can see my heart, beating,"
Now you can see it through my chest
"Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!"
I know that I must pass this test
"And you can see my heart, beating,"
Oh you can see it through my chest
"I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!"
I know that I must pass this test
"So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) I think I've had enough"
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'

How to make you feel like a man Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
"Girl in the world Chest to chest, nose to nose"
"Palm to palm, we were always just that close"
"Wrist to wrist, toe to toe"
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
"For your heart on me, my California king Eye to eye, cheek to cheek"
"Side by side, you were sleeping next to me"
"Arm in arm, dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn"
And a little last night on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
"For your heart on me, my California king Just when I felt like giving up on us"
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
California wishing on these stars
"For your heart on me, my California king My California king"
My California king In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
"For your heart on me, my California king That's how much I love you"
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No) But you won't let me
"You upset me, girl"
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did (But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
"For too long, that's wrong (But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch"
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
"Said I despise that I adore you And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)"
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
"And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)"
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)
"The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh) Sad, and it's not fair"
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond a reason why
"And it just ain't right And I hate how much I love you, girl"
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
"And I hate how much I love you, girl"
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
"Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That's how much I love you (how much I need you)"
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
"That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)"
That's how much I need you (I need you) And I hate that I love you so
"And I hate how much I love you, boy"
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)
"And I hate how much I love you, boy"
"But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)"
"And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And I hate that I love you so, so Shine bright like a diamond"
"Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy"
"You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky"

"When we first met, I never felt something so strong"
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
"You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?"
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
"And now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking"
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed It's like I checked into rehab
"And, baby, you're my disease"
It's like I checked into rehab
"And, baby, you're my disease"
I gotta check into rehab
"'Cause, baby, you're my disease"
I gotta check into rehab
"'Cause, baby, you're my disease Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?"
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
"It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you"
"You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?"
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
"'Cause now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking"
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more

Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station
"Sex with me so amazing, amazing, amazing hmmmm Sex with me"
So amazing Everywhere is still
everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
suddenly I'm scared to be apart.
The days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe.
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide
I Don't know should I go or should I stay?
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me.
That's the part I can't forget
and I wish that you'd come save me
cause' I'm standing over the edge. I should let you go
tell myself the things I need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong.
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here.
Feels like I drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between.
Somehow you got me where it really hurts
And it's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide.
I don't know should I go or should I stay.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me
that's the part I can't forget.
And I wish that you'd come save me boy
cause I'm standing over the edge. loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
And I... had as much as I can take
and love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
And I'm way past every moment
but I'm still determined to fight
and I know it's taking all my strength
to keep emotion alive.
"Loving you is suicide Te amo, te amo, she say's to me"
I hear the pain in her voice
"Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead"
"That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist"
"I told her no, she cried Te amo"
"I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry and without asking why
"I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said"
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
"Don't it mean I love you Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe"
"I hold her hand, I got no choice, uhh"
"Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave"
"She's begging me and asking why it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist"
"I told her no, she cried Te amo"
"I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry and without asking why
"I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said"
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Yes we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I move under the light because I understand
"That we all need love, and I'm not afraid"
"I feel the love but I don't feel that way Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist"
"I told her no, she cried Te amo"
"I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry and without asking why
"I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said"
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you
"I think it means I love you, I love you Te amo, te amo, don't it mean I love you Yayo, yayo"

To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
"Watch out, you might just go under"
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in Disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light

But I won't No you don't need my protection
"But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking"
"I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes Somewhere close to you"
Close to you
"Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out"
"Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you Said you let it go, you kept it"
Working hard to perfect it

All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
"Everybody right here,"
What you need to do is be thankful
"For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?"
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
"Let's give it to 'em baby girl You're gonna be, a shinin' star"
"In fancy clothes, and fancy cars"
"And then you'll see, you're gonna go far"
"'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are"
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
"You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life"
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
"Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life"
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
"No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life"
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
"'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life"
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
"My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life Hey, never mind what haters say"
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
"You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away You're gonna be, a shinin' star"
"In fancy clothes, and fancy cars"
"And then you'll see, you're gonna go far"
"'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are"
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
"You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life"
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
"Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life"
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
"No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life"
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
"'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life"
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
"Where you from, who you know"
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
"Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly"
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
"And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? You're gonna be, a shinin' star"
"In fancy clothes, and fancy cars"
"And then you'll see, you're gonna go far"
"'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are"
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
"You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life"
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
"Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life"
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
"No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life"
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
"'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life"
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
"So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'"
"Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')"
"Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop"
We gon' post up on the top spot
"Livin' the life, the life"
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
"The life, my life"
I do it how I wanna do
"I'm livin' my life, my life"
I will never lose
"I'm livin' my life, my life"
And I'll never stop it (So live your life) Come Mr. DJ song pon de replay

So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
"But I'm turnt up off sizz' and ""I love you"""
"Is the only thing that's in my mind You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe"
"Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe"
"I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late"
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray
With a little bit too much to say Ghost in the mirror
"I knew your face once, but now it's unclear"
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
"We lost connection, oh come back to me"
So I can feel alive again
"Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time"
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
"To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror"
"I knew your face once, but now it's unclear"
And I can't feel my body now
"I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart, this time"
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
"To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Be in love again I'm not the type to get my heart broken"
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
"But at the time it didn't mean a thing My mind is gone, I'm spinning round"
"And deep inside, my tears I'll drown"
"I'm losing grip, what's happening"
"I stray from love, this is how I feel"
This time was different
"Felt like, I was just a victim"
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
"Now I'm, in this condition"
"And I've, got all the symptoms"
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
"Can't figure out how you stole my heart My mind is gone, I'm spinning round"
"And deep inside, my tears I'll drown"
"I'm losing grip, what's happening"
"I stray from love, this is how I feel"
This time was different
"Felt like, I was just a victim"
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
"Now I'm, in this condition"
"And I've, got all the symptoms"
Of a girl with a broken heart
"But no matter what you'll never see me cry How did I get here with you, I'll never know?"
"I never meant to let it get so, personal"
"And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you"
I'm broken hearted I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry This time was different
"Felt like, I was just a victim"
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
"Now I'm, in this condition"
"And I've, got all the symptoms"
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry This time was different
"Felt like, I was just a victim"
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
"Now I'm, in this condition"
"And I've, got all the symptoms"
Of a girl with a broken heart

He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
"Tricks calling the house, non-stop its"
Getting out of control

Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things

"See my Louis tux, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt"

And hold on if you're losing your way
"Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go"
Hold on tighter if you going my way Someone take this gloom and walk right on
Take it some place that I don't go
Tried to push myself but it just holds me back The stronger I go I'm learning fast to fly away
And I took the blues all in one
"I turn around all these smiling all the way to the sun Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go"
And hold on if you're losing your way
"Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go"
Hold on tighter if you going my way Steady as you go hold your hand in mine
Don't stop if you're moving on
"Put your mind into a happy photograph Ain't no worry at all, I'm getting stronger everyday"
"It feels so good just to smile, feels just like"
"I can take a thousand miles in my stride, hey, yeah Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go"

And hold on if you're losing your way
"Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go"
"Hold on tighter if you going my way We stay moving around, solo"
"Ask us where you at, we don't know"
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
"Patron on the brain, ball player in the face"
"They shake the spot, she's just another case Easy for a good girl to go bad"
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
"We die forever He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah"
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
"All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere"
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
"Tricks calling the house, non-stop its"
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
"He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end"
I packed my bag and left with your best friend Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
"We die forever We stay moving around, solo"
"Ask us where you at, we don't know"
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever We gone forever
"We gone forever Yeah, yeah"
"Yeah, yeah I ain't tryin' to think about it, no"
"Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it, uh"
I want you to homicide it
Going slow and I want you to pop it uh
And I think I kinda like ya
"Up against the wall, we don't need a title uh Yeah, I said it"
"Yeah, I said it, babe"
"Yeah, I said it, fuck a title uh Boy I always like to show"
"Get a little bit, come a little close, no"
Take it home on your camera phone
"Get a little bad, nigga, watch me blow it down Yeah, I said it"
"Yeah, I said it, babe"
"Yeah, I said it (ooh yeah) Yeah, I said it"
"Yeah, I said it, babe"
"Yeah, I said it (ooh yeah) You could be rough, boy, but if you won't"

"Yeah, I said it uh Yeah, I said it"
"Yeah, I said it, babe"
"Yeah, I said it Oh yeah"
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
But this just ain't working
Stop thinking
You can run over me
"Drifting, settling off to a foreign place If I can't see what's in front of me"
It's a mystery
Well than apparently Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
"Go on, be gone, bye bye, so long Can't you see that your fading"
"Fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away"
I opened up my eyes
And I finally realized
"Today, today, it's too late"
You're fading away Put a sock in it
Just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up
I ain't coming back again
"No way, no way, no way, no way Cause I'm so fed up"
Boy you got me messed up
If you hit me back up
"Don't press your luck today, today"
I'm blowing you away Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
"Go on, be gone, ta ta, so long Can't you see that your fading"
"Fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away"
I opened up my eyes
And I finally realized
"Today, today, it's too late"
You're fading away Saw you turn into a ghost
Right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do
When she's crying inside
I'm about to go insane
I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong of right
I'll be gone by night Can't you see that your fading
"Fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away"
I opened up my eyes
And I finally realized
"Today, today, it's too late"
You're fading away [Intro: Rihanna]

I'm standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself

You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat

"Got a call from my girl saying ""RiRi"
Saw your man in the club
i thought he was out of town doing business
"said that he'd be back in three weeks?"""
And now I'm mad
Sitting in the kitchen gettin sad
"Looking at your pictures Boy, How could you lie to me"
Thought you would die for me
"I'm not acceptin another apology After 3 years, Ima let it go"
cant standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
Ima leave your heart broken on the floor You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room

"But we been in this relationship too long, girl"
For you to be listenin to your silly home girls
"Better go on, girl"
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper
You know them haters
You hear that 808
"The drum, that's my heart beat"
"I'm going numb, I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed"
I'm going under cardiac arrest Rihanna:
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed

You're gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heart beat
Flat line on the EKG Flat line on the EKG Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger
It seems like more than distance between us In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king
My California king In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king Woo
"Woo, woo, yeah"
"Woo, woo"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah I bet she could never make you cry"
'Cause the scars on your heart are still mine
Tell me that she couldn't get this sting
'She can almost be the worst of me'
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to plea
Maybe you just need to send for me Send for me
send for me
Send for me (woo)

"Woo, woo"
Yeah
"Woo, woo"
"(Woo, woo)"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah I've been thinking bout ya late night"

"Run it back like you owe me something Woo, woo (feel me up, feel me up)"
"Woo, woo, yeah (feel me up, feel me up)"
"Woo woo (feel me up, feel me up) Tell me 'bout your picture perfect darling"
Tell me how you think without the drugs

I don't even really love you
I don't even really care about you

How could you let us down?
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love (stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love (you don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's not too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late) And I still don't know Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
I'm thinking in black and white
Thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love (stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love (you don't have what it takes)
"(Stop before it's too late) Man, I know that it is hard to digest"
But maybe this story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
"But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets"
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
"But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets"
"But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets Feel like a brand new person"
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking you're the only option (feel like a brand new person)
I finally know what it's like
"Stop thinking you're the only option, oh (in a new direction)"
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking you're the only option (feel like a brand new person)
And I don't know how to describe (Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option (But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
Stop thinking you're the only option (Come on)
I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night
(Come on)
I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
"Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night"
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night-time is the right time I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
"Move, move, move"
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
"Move, move, move"
Dancing in the dark Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna dance fast in the middle of the night
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night-time is the right time I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
"Move, move, move"
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
"Move, move, move"
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night
(Come on)
I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
"Move, move, move"
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
"Move, move, move"
Dancing in the dark Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
"Fell in love, I fell in love"
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be? It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
"Now all I got are these photographs All I've got, all I've got"
All I've got are these photographs
"All I've got, all I've got"
"Is nothing without you, you, you"
"Got nothing without you, you, you"
Got nothing without you Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
"I need me a remedy, been looking for remedies"
"I need you to be around, baby I'm hurting now"
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
"So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey All I've got, all I've got"
All I've got are these photographs
"All I've got, all I've got"
"Is nothing without you, you, you"
"Got nothing without you, you, you"
Got nothing without you All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
"This is me and you, you're my superstar"
"I'd give anything, baby here's my heart"
"My heart, my heart My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over"
"My loving never stop, even though that it's over"
Girl I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand-mama's sofa
Girl I got us lovey dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
"You had your GUESS jeans on looking sexy, oh huh girl"
Why could it not be the one? Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
"Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?) All I've got, all I've got"
Is nothing without you
"All I've got, all I've got"
"Is nothing without you, you, you"
"Is nothing without you, you, you"
"Is nothing without you All I've got, is nothing without"
"All I've got, is nothing without"
All I've got
All I've got are these photographs Chris Brown:
